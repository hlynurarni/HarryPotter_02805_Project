'''Godelot''' was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Dark Wizard|dark wizard]] who once owned the [[Elder Wand]].<ref>{{DH|B|21}}</ref> Described as an "''unpleasant character''", Godelot considered the Elder Wand to be an instructor, and used his knowledge of the wand's powers to write ''[[Magick Moste Evile]]'', a book that contained information on [[Dark Arts|dark magic]]. Despite his affinity towards dark magic, he refused to discuss [[Horcrux]]es, deeming them and the ritual involved too dark even for him. Godelot perished in his own cellar, after he was locked in by his son, [[Hereward]], who did this to gain ownership of the [[Elder Wand]].<ref>{{TBB|R}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "''The Tale of the Three Brothers''"''</ref>
