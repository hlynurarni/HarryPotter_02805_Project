{{Quote|But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.|Description|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
This group of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students were '''friends''' of [[James Potter II]] in [[2017]]. On [[1 September]], 2017, James ran to join them on the [[Hogwarts Express]].<ref>{{DH|E}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown if this group were the heirs to the legacy of the [[Marauders]] and  [[Fred and George Weasley|the Weasley twins]]. Seeing how James had connections to both groups — first being that [[James Potter I|James Potter]] was his paternal grandfather and namesake, as well as being the nephew of the Weasley twins — this is a possibility.
*It is unknown if James shared the [[Marauders' Map]] with them.
