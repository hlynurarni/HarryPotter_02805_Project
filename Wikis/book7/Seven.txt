{{Quote|Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your [[soul]] in more [[Horcrux|pieces]], I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven--?|[[Tom Riddle]] discusses the power of the number seven|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Wenlock0508-cut.gif|250px|thumb|[[Bridget Wenlock]]]]

'''Seven''' is the most powerful [[magic]]al number,<ref name="HBP23">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref> based on centuries of mythology, [[science]], and mathematics, and therefore has a very important role in the wizarding world. [[Arithmancer]] [[Bridget Wenlock]] was the first to note this through a theorem which exposed the magical properties of the number seven.<ref name="WOM">{{JKRS}}</ref>

==History==

The [[Arithmancy|Arithmancer]], [[Bridget Wenlock]] ([[1202]]–[[1285]]) was the first [[Wizardkind|witch]] to establish the magical properties of the number seven.<ref name="WOM"/> She wrote her ground-breaking theorem on the back of a sugar packet, using her usual [[invisible ink]]. She then proceeded to send [[Bridget Wenlock's cousin|her cousin]] a letter, forgot where she wrote the theorem, and thought it was on the envelope. She hunted down the envelope and intercepted it at her cousin's house, where she learned her mistake.<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}}</ref>

Seven is the age by which most experts believe that [[magic]] will reveal itself in a [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]].<ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==

====Dates====
*The first book was released in 1997, and the final book was released in 2007.
*The epilogue itself is set in 2017.
*Many fans expected {{DH}} (the seventh book) to be released on 07/07/2007, which also happened to be a Saturday, the day upon which Harry Potter books had previously been released. However, it was released on July 21<sup>st</sup> of that year instead, two weeks later. It is thought that the more 'magical' date was rejected due to it also being the second anniversary of the 7/7 London Bombings in 2005. (21 is still a multiple of 7 though.)
*On 7 August, the Harry Potter series won seven awards at the 2011 Teen Choice Awards for [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Deathly Hallows: Part 1]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]].
*The [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in on [[2 May]], the 2nd day of the 5th month. 2 +5 = 7
*The first [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|film]] in the ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' trilogy is set 70 years before the ''Harry Potter'' series.

Rowling Talks Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2]</ref>

====Miscellaneous====
*The number on the back of Harry Potter's [[Quidditch]] robes in the films is seven (this could be a reference to the fact that usually the best player/captain in a football team, has the number 7 shirt).
*[[J. K. Rowling]] stated in interview that she chose to write seven books in total because she spent seven years in secondary school. Also, she wanted Harry to come of age at seventeen because it "just seems a good number for a wizard to come of age."
*In the seventh Harry Potter book, J.K. split the dedication in seven parts.
*There were seven clues and seven opportunities to sign up and register for the {{PM}} beta. The first clue was on 31 July 2011 (Harry's birthday) and the final was 6 August 2011. A clue was released each day and each clue was from a book in the series corresponding to the day. For example, day one's clue was from [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] and the final clue was from [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]].
*In Harry's copy of {{FB}}, he wrote in the [[Pixie]] section for the classification, and put seven X's: "or ''XXXXXXX'' if you're [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]]."
*Seven is also a unique number, being the highest, single-digit prime number.
