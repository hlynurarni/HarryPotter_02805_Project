{{Quote|If his stories accurately reflect his opinions, he rather liked Muggles, whom he regarded as ignorant rather than malevolent; he mistrusted [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]], and he believed that the worst excesses of wizardkind sprang from the all-too-human traits of cruelty, apathy or arrogant misapplication of their own talents. The heroes and heroines who triumph in his stories are not those with the most powerful magic, but rather those who demonstrate the most kindness, common sense, and ingenuity.|[[J. K. Rowling (in-universe)|J. K. Rowling]] regarding Beedle|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}

'''Beedle the Bard''' (fl. [[15th century]])<ref>{{TBB}}, pp. ix, 12</ref> was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and author of wizarding fairytales. Beedle was born in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]]. At some point in his life he wrote {{TBB}}. The only known image of Beedle is a woodcut that shows him with a "luxuriant" beard. Beedle wrote in ancient [[rune]]s, which were later translated to English.

Taking his stories as an indicator of his opinions, he seems to have held [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] in higher esteem than most of his contemporaries. He also valued traits such as: kindness, common sense, and ingenuity.
