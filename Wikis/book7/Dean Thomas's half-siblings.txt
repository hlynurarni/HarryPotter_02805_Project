[[Dean Thomas]] had several [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] '''half-siblings'''. They were the children of [[Dean Thomas's stepfather|Mr]] and [[Dean Thomas's mother|Mrs Thomas]], and grew up in [[London]], [[England]] with their parents and half-brother.<ref name="JKR">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221017/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=2 Dean Thomas's Background] at {{JKRS}} (via the Internet Archive)</ref>

==Biography==
When Dean was forced to go on the run after the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] was created in [[1997]], his parents and sisters were very worried about him. ''[[Potterwatch]]'' asked its listeners to pass on any news they might have about him.<ref name="DH22">{{DH|B|22}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown how many half-siblings Dean had or any of their names. [[J. K. Rowling]] has only said that he has ''"a number of half-brothers and sisters."''<ref name="JKR" />
*Contrary to what J.K says, in the Deathly Hallows Lee Jordan says on ''Potterwatch'' that "his parents and sisters are desperate for news" meaning he could only have female half-sibling or that Lee knew only of his sisters and not his brothers. Or that his half-brothers do not know he's missing due their age.
