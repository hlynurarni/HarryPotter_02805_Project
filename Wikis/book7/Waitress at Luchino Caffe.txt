This '''waitress''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who worked as an employee at the [[Luchino Caffe]] on [[Tottenham Court Road]], [[London]].<ref name="DH9"/>

==Biography==
[[File:2017-07-24 (2).png|259x259px|thumb|The Waitress working at the cafe]]
At the all night [[Luchino Caffe]] on [[Tottenham Court Road]] in [[London]], she served two cappuccinos to [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] on the evening of [[1 August]], [[1997]]. [[Harry Potter]] was also with them, but under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]]. The waitress chewed gum as she worked and shot Ron a nasty look after overhearing him remark that her [[coffee]] was "revolting". She was then affronted when two more customers rudely waved her away when she shuffled over to take their order.<ref name="DH9"/>

These customers were, in fact, the [[Death Eaters]] [[Thorfinn Rowle]], and [[Antonin Dolohov]]; they had tracked Harry, Ron, and Hermione down using the [[Taboo|Taboo curse]]. A [[Luchino Caffe Duel|skirmish]] broke out in the café, and a [[Stunning Spell]] Harry was aiming at Dolohov struck the waitress, making her collapse near the door as she was attempting to flee in terror. Afterwards, Hermione [[Memory Charm|wiped her memory]] of the event, and the the effects of the Stunning Spell wore off once the trio had [[Apparition|Disapparated]].<ref name="DH9">{{DH|B|9}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{DH|F1}}, the waitress is portrayed by [[Great Britain|British]] actress [[Eva Alexander]].<ref name="IMDb">{{IMDb name|1604904|Eva Alexander}}</ref>
*In the film, [[Harry Potter]] does not use his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]] and as such the waitress also serves Harry a cappuccino. When the trio is attacked by Rowle and Dolohov, the waitress is not present and does not notice anything amiss as she is listening to music on a [[headset]] in the back room. When she comes out, she is shocked by the devastation, and is told by Hermione to "leave." The Memory Charm is not used on her.
