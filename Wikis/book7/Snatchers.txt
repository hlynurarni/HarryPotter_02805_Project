'''Snatchers''' were members of an organisation of bounty hunters formed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] when he seized control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in the summer of [[1997]].<ref name="DH19">{{DH|B|19}}</ref>

It appeared to be a relatively informal organisation with the main purpose of rounding up or arresting [[Muggle-born]]s and "[[blood traitor]]s" (when, at the time, simply being one made one an outlaw).<ref name="DH19"/> However, they also responded when the [[Taboo|Taboo curse]] was triggered by someone using the Dark Lord's name.<ref name="DH23">{{DH|B|23}}</ref> At least some of them based themselves in a [[Snatcher Camp]] in the [[Forest of Dean]].<ref name="DHG1">{{DH|G1}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Snatchers woods.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Typical Snatchers looking for easy money]]

The Snatchers organisation was formed by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] after it was taken over by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] on [[1 August]] [[1997]], with the purpose of rounding up [[Muggle-borns]], [[blood traitor]]s and [[Order of the Phoenix]] members, i.e. [[Undesirable]]s on the run. Snatchers were active all over the country and formed Snatcher camps which served as local bases of operation.<ref name="DH19"/>

[[Image:snatcher.png|thumb|210px|right|Snatchers hunting for victims]]
When [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] temporarily abandoned the [[Horcrux]] [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|hunt]] with [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]], he was cornered by five Snatchers, who hoped that he was a [[Muggle-born]] so they could turn him in to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] for a reward. However, he told them that he was [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]]. While they were arguing about whether or not he was lying (Ron suggested that they were not all that intelligent, and thought that one of them even had a trace of [[Troll]] blood), Ron managed to seize two Snatcher's wands and then escape.<ref name="DH19"/>

Around Easter of [[1998]], Fenrir Greyback's group of Snatchers tracked down a group of [[Wizardkind|wizards]] and [[goblin]]s that included [[Dean Thomas]] and [[Griphook]], whom they captured.<ref name="DH23"/>It is likely that they were responsible for the deaths of Dean and Griphook's other travelling companions, [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], [[Dirk Cresswell]], and [[Gornuk]].<ref name="DH22"/>

[[File:Bloatedface.jpg.jpg|239x239px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]] being captured by a group of Snatchers]]

Soon after, the same group discovered [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], after Harry accidentally triggered the [[Taboo]] on Voldemort's name. Harry claimed that he was "Vernon Dudley', a [[Slytherin]] student and son of a [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] official. Ron claimed to be [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] again, but was not believed, and then said he was "Barny Weasley". Hermione said she was [[Penelope Clearwater]] and a [[half-blood]]. Their story may have been believed, but Hermione's picture was spotted in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', which declared her to be "''the [[Mudblood]] who is known to be travelling with Harry Potter''".<ref name="DH23"/>

Greyback then decided to bring the group to [[Malfoy Manor]], where he seemed particularly eager to bite Hermione Granger. However, all the Snatchers but Greyback were [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] after she spotted [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword]] among the items they had seized. The Snatchers and the [[Death Eaters]] were ultimately thwarted, and the trio [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|escaped along with a few other prisoners]].<ref name="DH23"/>

[[File:Scabior.png|238x238px|thumb|left|Scabior and other snatchers falling from the collapsing [[Wooden Bridge]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts|battle]]]]

Shortly before midnight on [[1 May]], [[1998]], [[Scabior]] led the Snatchers in a charge to the [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts Grounds]] in order to take part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. They were unware of the magical protections around the school; [[Three unidentified Snatchers who disintegrated during the Battle of Hogwarts|three of their number]] were killed on the spot when they crossed the magical barrier. After the [[Death Eaters]] broke down the protective enchantments, the Snatchers stormed into the [[Wooden Bridge]] and started [[Skirmish at the Wooden Bridge|a short duel]] with [[Neville Longbottom]] that resulted in the collapse of the bridge and the deaths of [[Scabior]] and several of the Snatchers. The remaining Snatchers were either killed in battle, sent to Azkaban, or fled the country after the fall of the Dark Lord.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref><ref name="WU">{{WU}} (Brilliant Event: Darkness Raising Part 1)</ref>

==Role==
[[File:Snatchers during Battle.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Snatchers at the Battle of Hogwarts]]

The Snatchers seem to have been a militia formed from wizarding mercenaries less able and competent than Voldemort's elite [[Death Eaters]] and led by 'pack leaders' such as [[Fenrir Greyback]].<ref name="DH19"/> They were subordinate to the Death Eaters, as demonstrated by the disdainful treatment Greyback and his gang received at [[Malfoy Manor]]. Despite outnumbering [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] four to one, they were ignominiously defeated.<ref name="DH23"/>

It is possible that skilled Snatchers were appointed as [[Death Eaters]], as this seems to fit in with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] claim that he "rewards his helpers". As there were a dozen Death Eaters guarding the village of [[Hogsmeade]] alone, it is likely that Lord Voldemort was recruiting more Death Eaters to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, and those particular ones were Snatchers who managed to get on Voldemort's good side. This would be an ideal way to recruit new Death Eaters, and eliminate those who were not worthy of the Dark Mark in Voldemort's eyes. Voldemort used their large numbers to his advantage when he attacked Hogwarts; utilising them to test the ancient castle's magical defences as well as overwhelming the defenders when they assaulted the castle itself.

Some of the Snatchers seem to be well aware of their inferiority to the Death Eaters and the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] that they were controlling. While they turn in Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for bounty money, they believed that if they turn in Harry Potter to the Ministry instead of directly to Voldemort, the Ministry would take all the glory while leaving the platoon of Snatchers out of the transaction.<ref name="DH23"/>

==Apparel==
Unlike the [[Death Eaters]], who were a highly regimented and uniformed organisation, the Snatchers had no formal dress code, and as such the apparel of each Snatcher was unique. As their work required them to travel the length and breadth of the country, and deal with changing weather conditions, most Snatchers chose to garb themselves in clothes such as thick jumpers, hooded sweatshirts, jackets made of leather, fur or other heavy weather-proof materials, woollen hats and boots or other cross-country suitable footwear, and favoured dark shades of black, brown, grey, blue, red and, green to blend in with surroundings.<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

Each Snatcher wore a strip of dark red fabric tied around his or her left arm, signifying their position within the new regime. These armbands were also worn by members of the [[Ministry Police]] suggesting a possible connection between the two groups. Some Snatchers also chose to smear their eyes with some sort of black make-up. This was presumably a protective measure to minimise sun glare while pursuing their quarry, and also to appear more intimidating.<ref name="DHF1"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The word Snatcher has been translated into other languages, including Polish: [[Wikipedia:Szmalcownik|Szmalcownik (sing.), Szmalcownicy (pl.)]] Instead of creating a neologism, the translator decided to use much more appropriate word coined during World War II - "Szmalcownicy" (a Polish term for a Nazi collaborator who either blackmailed Jews gone into hiding, blackmailed Poles who hid Jews and/or betrayed either or both of them to the Nazi occupation authorities).
*In the film adaptation, instead of a just few Snatchers, there were hundreds, just as was done with the [[Death Eaters]] to the point of becoming a secondary army of foot soldiers similar to the dark creatures.
*The Snatchers bear a remarkable resemblance to the Nazi {{wplink|Gestapo}} and {{wplink|Schutzstaffel}}, which composed the {{wplink|Einsatzgruppen}} that rounded up Jews and other groups targeted by them before and during World War II.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|first]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|second]] film adaptations of {{DH}} each Snatcher wears a strip of red fabric tied around his or her left arm. This is an obvious reference to the swastika armbands worn by members of the Nazi secret service or the red armbands worn by Communist secret police during the Russian Civil War. Furthermore, several Snatchers are seen sporting leather trench coats, which were commonly worn by members of the Nazi Gestapo.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|first]] & [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|second]] film adaptations of {{DH}}, instead of [[Fenrir Greyback|Greyback]] being the leader, [[Scabior]] appears to be leading the party and is seen interrogating the ones they snatch.
*When Snatchers charge at Hogwarts to participate in the final battle in {{DH|F2}}, they act as a militia, supporting the regulars, in this case Death Eaters.
*In the film Scabior plays with the word Snatcher, saying ''Snatch 'em''.
*The Snatchers are very similar to the [[Scourers]] that once terrorised the nascent wizarding community of America.
