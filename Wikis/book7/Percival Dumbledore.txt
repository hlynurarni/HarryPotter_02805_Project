'''Percival Dumbledore''' (fl. [[1881]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the husband of [[Kendra Dumbledore]] and the father of [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]], [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Ariana Dumbledore]]. After attacking [[Unidentified Mould-on-the-Wold boys|three male Muggles]] who assaulted Ariana, he was sentenced to imprisonment in [[Azkaban]]. Percival died there sometime later after [[1890]].<ref name="DH28"/> Many years later, [[Albus Dumbledore|his eldest son]] became the longest and most noted [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was considered by some as the greatest wizard of all time.

==Biography==
Percival was born into a [[pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] family. In his later life, he married a [[Muggle-born]] witch named [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]] with whom he had three children: [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] (who bore the same as his second name), [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]].<ref name="DH28"/>

At the age of six, Percival's daughter Ariana was assaulted by [[Unidentified Mould-on-the-Wold boys|three Muggle boys]]. The incident left her permanently traumatised and unable to control her magic powers. Percival, in a fit of vengeful rage, attacked her assailants. This resulted in his arrest and conviction by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. He was sentenced to [[Azkaban]], where he later died. Percival never admitted the reasons for his attack on the Muggles. This was largely due to his fear that if the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] found out about his daughter's delicate condition, they would send her to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] for the rest of her life, effectively locking her away permanently as a hazard to the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].<ref name="DH28">{{DH|B|28}}</ref>

Percival's attack on the Muggle children led many to believe that he was a supporter of the notion of [[Blood status|blood purity]]. However, this was almost certainly untrue as Percival's own wife was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch]]. However, the Dumbledore family kept its secrets well, and Percival's reputation would remain tarnished even after the death of his 115-year-old son, Albus.<ref name="DH28"/>

When [[Albus Dumbledore]] put on the [[Peverell family|Peverell]] Ring, with hopes that using the [[Resurrection Stone]] would allow him to see his loved ones once more, one of the people he hoped to see — and apologise to — was his father.<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
As a relatively young wizard, Percival was described as "''a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle'',"<ref name="DH11">{{DH|B|11}}</ref> like his son, Albus, who, in his own time at Hogwarts, exhibited many of the same traits as his father.

==Relationships==
===Kendra Dumbledore===
[[File:Kendra Dumbledore.png|210x210px|thumb|Percival's wife, [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]]]]
Percival's relationship with his wife during their marriage is unknown, but they shared a devotion to their children, particularly their youngest, Ariana. Percival attacked the three boys who assaulted their daughter, and Kendra devoted the remainder of her life to taking care of Ariana.<ref name="DH28"/>

===Albus Dumbledore and Aberforth Dumbledore===

[[File:Aberforth Dumbledore.jpg|191x191px|thumb|right|Percival's son, Aberforth]]
Percival's relationship with his sons is not very clear. Percival did not seem to be held in high regard by Albus, especially for being imprisoned in Azkaban for an attack on three Muggles, but years later, Dumbledore wished to use the [[Resurrection Stone]] to bring back his deceased family and apologise to them — even his father, showing that Albus neverthless truly loved Percival despite all that happened. Like Albus, Aberforth may not have held his father in high regard either for his attack on the Muggles who attacked his sister, Ariana and being imprisoned in Azkaban.<ref name="DH28"/>

===Ariana Dumbledore===
{{Quote| ''[...]'' my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St Mungo's for good... We had to keep her safe and quiet.|[[Aberforth Dumbledore]] on Percival and Kendra Dumbledore|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Ariana_Dumbledore_Hog's_Head.jpg|191x191px|thumb|right|Percival's daughter, Ariana]]
Percival was devastated by his daughter's assault. He attacked the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] boys who did it and was sent to [[Azkaban]] for it. He never explained to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] his reasons, knowing that if they discovered [[Ariana Dumbledore]]'s condition, she would be confined to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] as a threat to the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]].<ref name="DH28"/>

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Percival (disambiguation)|Percival]] was a knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. The name is believed to be derived from the Old French ''percer val'', meaning "to pierce the valley".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/percival Behind the Name: Percival]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{DH|F1}}, [[Muriel]] claimed that Percival had ''"killed"'' the Muggles, rather than just [[Curse|cursing]] or magically assaulting them. She may have been exaggerating or the detail was changed in the film.
