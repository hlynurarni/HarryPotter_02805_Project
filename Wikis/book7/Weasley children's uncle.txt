{{Quote|Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son...|This uncle at [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|Bill and Fleur's wedding]]|{{DH}} }}

This '''uncle''' of the [[Weasley family|Weasley children]] got drunk at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] on [[1 August]], [[1997]]. He spent part of the wedding wondering whether or not [[Harry Potter]], who was disguised as a red-haired [[Weasley family|Weasley]] cousin, was his son.<ref>{{DH}}: "Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son..." (Ch. 8)</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*As it is known that [[Arthur Weasley]] had [[Arthur Weasley's brothers|two brothers]] and no sisters,<ref name="JKR">"[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7 Extra Stuff: The Weasley Family]" at {{JKRS}}</ref> it is widely assumed that the unnamed "uncle of Ron's" mentioned in {{DH}} is one of [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]]'s brothers, and thus a Weasley. However, since it is unknown whether [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]] and [[Fabian Prewett]] were [[Molly Weasley]]'s only siblings, it is possible the unnamed uncle was another brother of [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] or the husband of her sister.
