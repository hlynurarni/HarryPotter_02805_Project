The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree as both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.

'''Victoire Weasley''' (b. [[2 May]],<ref name="JKRV" /> early [[2000s]])<ref name="birthyear">Victoire must have been born in 2000 or later, inclusive, as she is still in attendance at Hogwarts in the 2017-2018 school year.</ref> was a [[Half-Veela|part]]-[[veela]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the eldest child of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]] {{c|née [[Delacour family|Delacour]]}}.<ref name="msnbc">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0729-dateline-vieira.html J.K. Rowling MSNBC Interview] on Accio! Quote</ref> She has two younger siblings, [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]] and [[Louis Weasley]]. Victoire started her education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early-to-mid [[2010s]]. She was also the girlfriend of [[Edward Lupin]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Victoire was born on 2 May<ref name="JKRV" /> in the early 2000s. She was given her name, which means "victory" in French, because her date of birth fell on the anniversary of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], in which [[Harry Potter]], the [[Order of the Phoenix]], and allies prevailed against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="JKRV" />

Victoire has two younger siblings: a sister, [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and a brother, [[Louis Weasley|Louis]].<ref name="WFT">"[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3105517.ece The Unwritten Story of Harry's Friends and Their Children]" from the Times Online</ref> Through her maternal great-grandmother, Victoire is [[Half-Veela|one-eighth]] [[Veela]]. It is possible she lived at [[Shell Cottage]] with her family.

===Hogwarts years===
Victoire began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early-to-mid [[2010s]].

When Victoire accompanied the rest of her family to the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in 2014, presumably she and Teddy Lupin were already in a relationship, as Rita Skeeter wrote of them snogging often. So much, in fact, they had their own section in Rita's article. The two of them sat together during the final match between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Brazil]], but seemed more interested in talking than watching the match. Victoire's father finally swapped places with her and directed her attention to the pitch, although she sulked about it. Later, she and Teddy managed to "''find their way back into adjacent seats''".<ref name="PMRS" />

On 1 September, 2017, Victoire's by-then-graduated boyfriend came to see her off for another year at [[King's Cross Station]]. Victoire's cousin, [[James Potter II|James Potter]], saw the couple snogging and interrupted them. When Teddy told him to leave, James returned to tell his family what he had seen, and his younger sister, [[Lily Potter|Lily]], expressed her wish that Teddy and Victoire would marry someday, making Teddy an official part of the extended [[Weasley family|Weasley]]-[[Potter family|Potter]] clan.<ref>{{DH}}, Epilogue</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Victoire was described as ''"very good-looking,"''<ref name="msnbc" /> which presumably indicates that she took after either her mother, [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]], or her father, [[William Weasley|Bill]], or both, in appearance. It could also link to her Veela ancestry, which might consequently make her beauty more profound. [[Rita Skeeter]] described her as blonde and beautiful.<ref name="PMRS" />

==Etymology==
Victoire means "victory" in [[France|French]], the native language of her mother [[Fleur Delacour]], probably chosen because she was born on the anniversary of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

==Behind the scenes==
*Both Victoire and [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]] have fathers who were attacked by the werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]].
*Both Victoire and Teddy Lupin have mothers with unique traits related to their physical appearances — [[Fleur Delacour]] has [[Veela]] blood, and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] was a [[Metamorphmagus]].
*Victoire and Teddy are fourth cousins once removed as they are both distant descendants of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]].<ref>[[House of Black#Family Tree|Black family tree]]</ref>
*In [[J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life]], when sketching the Weasley Family Tree, Rowling stated that Victoire was so named because she was born on the anniversary of the day the [[Second Wizarding War]] [[2 May|ended]].
*Victoire is the last character introduced during the Harry Potter series.
*Victoire is likely an homage to Elanor Gamgee from ''{{wplink|The Lord of the Rings}}'', who was born on the anniversary of the downfall of Sauron. Both were noted to be very beautiful.
*Victoire is similar to her aunt, Ginny Weasley, in that both are women (last and first of their generations), both fell in love and have a relationship with war-orphaned men (Teddy Lupin and Harry Potter, respectively) and both were considered to be extremely beautiful from a young age.
