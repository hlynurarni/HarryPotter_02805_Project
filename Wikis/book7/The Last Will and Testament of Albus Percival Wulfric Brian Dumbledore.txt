A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything?|[[Rufus Scrimgeour]] telling [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] about the will|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

'''''The Last Will and Testament of [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore]]''''' revealed one month after his death to [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] by [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]].

For thirty-one days, the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] had not carried out Dumbledore's wishes as laid out in the will, instead temporarily confiscating and inspecting them under the [[Decree for Justifiable Confiscation]] for clues as to what Dumbledore intended the three teenagers to do with the items he left them. As they were not able to find any [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]] in the items, the Ministry was no longer legally entitled to inspect them, and Scrimgeour brought them to [[the Burrow]] to give to Harry, Hermione, and Ron, interrupting Harry's [[31 July|birthday]] [[Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday party|celebrations]] in the process.

The will had been properly witnessed, and had been validated by [[Advocates to the Wizarding World]].

==Items left to Hogwarts==

{{Quote|They wanted to examine whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!.... The law was created to stop wizards passing on [[Dark Arts#Dark Items|Dark artefacts]], and the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?|[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] arguing with the Minister over his belated reading of Dumbledore's will|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Tumblr_n4jvdzjEc51r0go1eo4_250.gif|left|frame|Scrimgeour and the will]]

Almost all of Dumbledore's worldly possessions — including his books, magical instruments, and various other effects — were left to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He left many papers to the [[Hogwarts Archives]], among them a set of notes on {{TBB}}.<ref>{{TBB|E}} - Introduction (p. ''xiv'')</ref> Scrimgeour was especially suspicious that of all the individuals the late Headmaster might have bequeathed items to, he chose three students.<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

==Items left to individuals==
===The Golden Snitch===
{{Main|Harry Potter's first Golden Snitch}}

{{dialogue a-b|Scrimgeour|' ''To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill'' '… I noticed that your birthday cake is in the shape of a [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]]. Why is that?|Hermione|Oh, it can't be a reference to the fact Harry's a great [[Seeker]], that's way too obvious. There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!|Hermione’s sarcastic reaction to Scrimgeour’s suspicion|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Tumblr_lt4kgpcuXg1qa9jn1o7_250.gif|211x211px|thumb|Harry with the Snitch after Scrimgeour presents him with it]]

Harry received a [[Golden Snitch]] from Dumbledore; the first one he ever captured playing [[Seeker]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]]. Scrimgeour was suspicious that something was inside the Snitch, as Hermione mentioned that they had flesh memories. It should be noted, however, that this property of Snitches was not mentioned in {{QTA}}. When Harry touched the Snitch with his hand, nothing happened. Because Harry caught the Snitch in his mouth, however, it needed to be touched to his lips, which revealed that it was inscribed with the message ''"I open at the close."''

In May [[1998]], after Harry viewed [[Severus Snape]]'s memories and realised that he was meant to let [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] strike him with the [[Killing Curse]], he spoke the words "I am about to die" to the Snitch. This caused it to open, revealing the [[Resurrection Stone]] within. Harry used the stone to speak to his late [[James Potter I|father]] and [[Lily J. Potter|mother]], as well as [[Sirius Black]] and [[Remus Lupin]]. They stood by him as he walked to what he believed would be his death, offering him comfort and support.<ref name="DH"/>

===The Deluminator===
{{Main|Deluminator}}

{{Dialogue a-b|Rufus Scrimgeour|' ''To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it'' '… That is a valuable object. It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare? Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students, yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put to the Deluminator, Mr Weasley?|Ron Weasley|Put out lights, I s'pose. What else could I do with it?|Scrimgeour questioning Ron|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Ron_and_the_Deluminator.jpg|252x252px|thumb|left|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] using the Deluminator for the first time after [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] left it to him]]

Ron was bequeathed a [[Deluminator]] in Dumbledore's will. The trio used it when they were attacked by [[Death Eaters]] [[Antonin Dolohov]] and [[Thorfinn Rowle]] at [[Tottenham Court Road]]. Ron put the lights out while Hermione [[Memory Charm|wiped the Death Eaters' memories]], and he and Harry cleaned up the café. They used it again in the dungeon of [[Malfoy Manor]] as part of their [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|escape]].

Most importantly, Ron used the Deluminator to find Harry and Hermione after temporarily abandoning them in the autumn and winter of [[1997]]. He instantly regretted his decision to leave, which was influenced by the negative energy within [[Salazar Slytherin's Locket]], but was unable to find them until the sound of Hermione saying his name came from the Deluminator, which began to emit light which led him back to his friends. Ron saved Harry's life and destroyed the locket [[Horcrux]]. While Ron was glum about Dumbledore's apparent prediction that he would leave his friends, Harry pointed out that it meant Dumbledore knew he would always want to come back.<ref name="DH"/>

===''The Tales of Beedle the Bard''===
{{Main|Hermione Granger's copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}

{{dialogue a-b-a|Scrimgeour|' ''To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'', in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive'' '… Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?|Hermione|He… He knew I liked books.|But why that particular book?...  Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?|Scrimgeour questioning Hermione|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Hallows.svg|167x167px|thumb|The symbol of the [[Deathly Hallows]], inside the front cover of {{TBB}}]]

Dumbledore left Hermione a first edition of {{TBB}}, a collection of wizarding fairy tales. One of those tales was about the three brothers who apparently met Death and received [[Deathly Hallows|three objects]] that protected them from death. Inside the front cover was a symbol that led Hermione to want to visit [[Godric's Hollow]], where she saw the symbol on the grave of [[Ignotus Peverell]] and where she and Harry were [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1997)|attacked]] by [[Nagini]]. Hermione later wanted to visit [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], who had worn the symbol to the wedding of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]. At his [[Lovegood House|home]], Xenophilius told the trio about the [[Deathly Hallows]], and they narrowly escaped an [[Ambush at the Lovegood House|attempted ambush]].
[[File:Tumblr lt4kgpcuXg1qa9jn1o6 250.gif|220x220px|thumb|left|''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'']]
All of these events led to Harry understanding the importance of the [[Elder Wand]], which played a vital role in his final defeat of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Also, when Harry spoke to Dumbledore after allowing Voldemort to hit him with the [[Killing Curse]], Dumbledore revealed that he had given the book to Hermione in hopes that the trio would figure out the Deathly Hallows, but only gradually, so as to keep their focus on destroying the [[Horcrux]]es and to prevent Harry from being too tempted by the Hallows, as Dumbledore himself was.<ref name="DH"/>

Later in life, Hermione translated ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' from its original runes and published a new edition of it.<ref>{{TBB|R}}</ref>

===Sword of Gryffindor===
{{Main|Sword of Gryffindor}}

{{Dialogue a-b|Scrimgeour|According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy [[Gryffindor]]. That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided. Why do you think —?|Harry|Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword? Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.|Scrimgeour and Harry on Dumbledore’s second bequest|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

[[File:Gryffindor's_sword.jpg|160px|thumb|Sword of Gryffindor]]
Dumbledore also bequeathed the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] to Harry, but the Ministry refused to turn it over to him, as it was not Dumbledore’s property. Scrimgeour speculated that Dumbledore left Harry the sword of [[Godric Gryffindor]], because it might be capable of defeating the [[Tom Riddle|Heir]] of [[Salazar Slytherin]]. Harry scoffed at this, and grew angry over the Ministry’s continuing suspicion of him and covering up of facts instead of actually working towards the defeat of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. Scrimgeour, highly insulted, leapt up, and the two exchanged heated words before being interrupted by [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]]. Scrimgeour soon departed.

It is probable that Dumbledore put the sword in his will to clue Harry and his friends in to the sword’s importance to their quest to destroy Voldemort’s [[Horcrux]]es. As it was imbued with the venom of a [[basilisk]], the sword is one of the few items capable of destroying one. It would later be used by Ron to destroy [[Salazar Slytherin's Locket]] and by [[Neville Longbottom]] to kill [[Nagini]].<ref name="DH"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Prior to the stating of [[Hermione Granger]]'s full name in Dumbledore's will, her middle name was considered to be "Jane", as [[J. K. Rowling]] had stated in interviews. Rowling decided to change it to "Jean" so that Hermione would not share a middle name with [[Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Jane Umbridge]].
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{DH|F1}}, it is [[Arthur Weasley]] who reads Dumbledore's will and gives [[Trio|the trio]] what was left for them, rather than [[Rufus Scrimgeour]].
*Although Hermione scoffed at Scrimgeour's suspicions of [[Harry Potter's birthday cake from Molly Weasley|Harry's Snitch-shaped birthday cake]], Harry was able to open the Snitch by placing it against his mouth.
