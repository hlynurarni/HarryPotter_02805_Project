'''Maisie Cattermole''' (fl. 1997) was the daughter of [[Mary Cattermole|Mary]] and [[Reginald Cattermole]]. She had a brother, [[Alfred Cattermole|Alfred]], and a sister, [[Ellie Cattermole|Ellie]] and lived at [[27 Chislehurst Gardens|27]] [[Chislehurst Gardens]], [[Great Tolling]], [[Evesham]] with her parents, brother and sister.<ref>{{DH|B|13}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[Mary Cattermole]] said that Maisie and her siblings were frightened by their mother's interrogation by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. They believed that she would not return home.

Her mother told the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] that Maisie and her brother and sister were at home. They were probably not attending Hogwarts yet, because Harry Potter told her and her husband to pick up the children and run away.
