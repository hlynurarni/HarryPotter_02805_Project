'''Bertram Aubrey''' was a [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in the [[1970s]]. Once, he had an [[Illegal growth hex|illegal hex]] (perhaps ''[[Engorgio Skullus]]'') used on him by [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and [[Sirius Black]] which caused his head to grow twice its original size. It is unknown what motivated the duo to hex him, though it rewarded them a double detention.<ref name="HBP24">{{HBP|B|24}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Bertram means "bright raven", from Germanic roots. The name meaning has quite a connection with the Ravenclaw house (bright as in witty, and raven as in Ravenclaw), which could lead to speculation that Bertram Aubrey was a Ravenclaw.

The name Aubrey has multiple meanings. It can mean "noble and bright", "blond ruler" and "rules with elf wisdom". This could also connect him to Ravenclaw, being "bright".
