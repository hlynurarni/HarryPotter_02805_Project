==Etymology==
The name "Tiberius" is a Roman praenomen, or given name, meaning "of the Tiber" in Latin. The Tiber is the river that runs through Rome. Tiberius was the second Roman emperor, the stepson of emperor Augustus. He was a paranoid and sadistic emperor who ordered mass arrests whilst spending most of his time in his palace on the Isle of Capri, engaging in all manners of sexual immorality.
