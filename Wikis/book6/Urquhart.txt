'''Urquhart''' was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] and [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] during the [[1996–1997 school year|1996-1997]] [[Quidditch]] season at Hogwarts.<ref>{{HBP|B|14}}</ref> Urquhart was new to the squad and he had not held any position on the team before so it seems odd that he was made the Captain, playing as a [[Chaser]]. During the match against Gryffindor, Urquhart shook hands with Harry, 'crushing it'.
