'''Mr Patil''' was the father of [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Parvati and Padma Patil]]. During the [[1996–1997 school year]], he and his wife, [[Patil twins' mother|Mrs Patil]], feared their twin daughters would not be safe at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] because of the return of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. The couple nearly withdrew the girls from school, but ultimately refrained from doing so.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref> Upon [[Draco Malfoy]] succeeding in allowing [[Death Eaters]] entrance into the castle, they immediately reverted their decision and retrieved the twins.<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>
