{{Quote|Oh, she was perfect, obviously.

'''Wilkie Twycross''' (b. before [[1979]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and employee of the [[British Ministry of Magic]], who was the [[Apparition Instructor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] to students who were age seventeen or approaching age seventeen and wish to obtain a licence to [[Apparition|Apparate]].<ref name="HBP18"/>  

==Biography==
{{Quote|The important things to remember when [[Apparition|Apparating]] are the three D's.|Wilkie Twycross|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}Twycross was described as "''oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away''." [[Harry Potter]], upon meeting him, wondered whether this was because of the large amount of Apparating and Disapparating he did.<ref name="HBP18">{{HBP|B|18}}</ref> 

Many of the [[sixth year]] students in Twycross's [[1997]] [[Apparition (class)|Apparition class]] disliked and called him various insults, inspired by the "Three D's of Apparition" that he tried to teach them. The most moderate of these were "[[dog]]-breath" and "[[Faeces|dung]]-head." Perhaps because of this, Twycross seemed very fond of his few good students, such as [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name="HBP18"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Apparition]]''': As the [[Apparition Instructor]] for [[sixth year]] Hogwarts students, Twycross would have been highly accomplished in apparition as a form of [[magic]]al transportation. He had a very sophisticated understanding of the art of apparition, teaching his students the specifics needed to apparate successfully and the [[Splinching|dangers]] of it, showing his proficiency in this field.<ref name="HBP18"/>

==Etymology==
''{{w|Wilkie}}'' is a surname used in [[Scotland]] and [[England]] possibly a diminutive of William. ''{{w|Twycross}}'' is a small village and civil parish in Leicestershire, England. Also ''twy-'' is an archaic form of ''two'' so his surname could literally mean ''two-cross'', or one who crosses between two places; hence, one who Apparates.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is interesting to note that Rowling was reading Wilkie Collins' ''The Moonstone'' when she was writing {{HBP}},{{fact}} so it is possible that it is where she got the name.
