{{Quote|Trotting towards them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures [[Harry Potter|Harry]] had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with cruel, steel-coloured beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly-looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was attached to a long chain, and the ends of all of them were held in the vast hands of [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who came jogging into the paddock after the creatures.|Description|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
The '''Hogwarts Hippogriff herd''' is a herd of twelve [[Hippogriff]]s owned by [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The only named member of the herd was [[Buckbeak]]. It is unknown whether they live in Hogwarts permanently, or if they live elsewhere.<ref name="POA6"/>

==History==
In [[1993]], the herd was used by [[Professor]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to teach his [[Gryffindor]] and [[Slytherin]] [[Third year]]s about [[Hippogriff]]s, in his first [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class that year. They were kept in [[The Paddock|a large paddock]] during the lesson.<ref name="POA6">{{POA|B|6}}</ref>
