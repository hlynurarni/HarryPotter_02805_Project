'''Mr Longbottom''' (pre-[[1947]]<ref name="date" />—between [[1980]] and [[1995]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He was the father of [[Frank Longbottom]] and the paternal grandfather of [[Neville Longbottom]].<ref name="longbottomfamilytree" />

==Biography==
Mr Longbottom was born sometime before [[1947]]<ref name="date" /> into the [[Longbottom family]],<ref name="longbottomfamilytree" /> an old [[Great Britain|British]] [[pure-blood]] family, considered to be one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]].<ref name="pm-pureblood">{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref> He had one known sibling, a brother, [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]],<ref name="longbottomfamilytree" /> and may have had others.<ref>{{WW|the-quill-of-acceptance-and-the-book-of-admittance}} on {{PM}} states that Neville had "disappointed great aunts and uncles." [[Algie Longbottom|Algie]] and [[Enid Longbottom|Enid]] are Neville's only known great-aunt and great-uncle. Thus, Neville must have had at least one other great-aunt and one other great-uncle in addition to them, who could potentially be unknown siblings of Mr Longbottom and Algie.</ref>

He married a witch, [[Augusta Longbottom|Augusta]], with whom he had one son, [[Frank Longbottom|Frank]].<ref name="longbottomfamilytree" />

He died sometime between [[1980]] and [[1995]].<ref name="ootp21" /><ref name="longbottomfamilytree" /> His grandson, [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]], witnessed his death, thus enabling the boy to see [[Thestral]]s at a young age.<ref name="ootp21" /><ref name="longbottomfamilytree" /> Neville revealed as much to [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Dolores Umbridge]] during her time evaluating a [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson.<ref name="ootp21" />

==Behind the scenes==
*Neville states in {{QH}} that, in [[1947]], his "granddad" put a [[fanged gerbil]] into Augusta's handbag as a joke, prompting her to keep a mousetrap in her bag at all times thereafter. It is likely that this refers to Mr Longbottom, rather than to Neville's maternal grandfather, i.e. [[Alice Longbottom]]'s father.
