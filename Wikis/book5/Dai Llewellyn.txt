"'''Dangerous'''" '''Dai Llewellyn''' was a very famous [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Quidditch]] player for the [[Caerphilly Catapults]], and was noted for the risks he took during a match.<ref name="QTAR7">{{QTA|R|7}}</ref> 

==Biography==
He died when he was eaten by a [[Chimaera]] while on holiday in [[Mykonos]], [[Greece]]. His [[death]] resulted in a day of national mourning for all Welsh [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]]. Llewellyn was honoured by the creation of the [[Dangerous Dai Commemorative Medal|Dangerous Dai Llewellyn Commemorative Medal]], and [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] named the [["Dangerous" Dai Llewellyn Ward for Serious Bites|Serious Bites ward]] after him. [[Kennilworthy Whisp]] wrote a biography of the player entitled ''[[He Flew Like a Madman]]''.<ref name="QTAR7">{{QTA|R|7}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Dai Llewellyn|Dai Llewelyn]] was a Welsh socialite who died in 2009. 
The name might be an allusion to actor [[Wikipedia:Desmond Llewelyn|Desmond Llewelyn]], who played the character "Q" in the [[Wikipedia:James Bond (film series)|''James Bond'' films]] from 1963 to 1999. The name "Dai" is derived from the old Celtic word ''dei'' meaning "to shine", but is also a commonly-used nickname in Wales as a familiar form of the name "David", so it's quite likely that this was 'Dangerous' Dai's real first name.
