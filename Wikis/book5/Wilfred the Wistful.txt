}}'''Wilfred the Wistful''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] from an unknown period. A statue of him was located in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. [[Mrs Norris]] disappeared behind the statue when she encountered [[Harry Potter]] heading towards the [[Owlery]] in [[1995]].<ref>{{OOTP|B|14}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Wilfred" means "desiring peace" from Old English wil "will, desire" and frið "peace". Saint Wilfrid was a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon bishop. The name was rarely used after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 19th century.
