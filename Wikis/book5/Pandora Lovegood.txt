'''Pandora'''<ref name="illness"/> '''Lovegood''' (died c. [[1990]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was married to [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], the editor of ''[[The Quibbler]]'', and with him had one child, [[Luna Lovegood]].

Pandora died in either [[1990]] or [[1991]] when her own spell backfired, when Luna was nine.<ref name="illness">{{WW|illness-and-disability}}</ref> Harry saw a photo of Luna and Pandora while visiting the [[Lovegood House|Lovegoods' house]] in which Luna looked more well-groomed than he had ever seen her, which suggested that Pandora was not as absent minded as Xenophilius, or that Luna's mother was more demanding about her personal appearance, as opposed to Luna's father, who was generally known as a scruffy, unkempt man.

According to her daughter, Pandora was an extraordinary [[Wizardkind|witch]] who liked to experiment with [[spell]]s. One day in [[1990]] or [[1991]], [[Pandora Lovegood's unknown spell|one of these experiments]] went wrong, killing her in a "horrible" manner in front of Luna, who was subsequently able to see [[Thestral]]s because of it. Luna told [[Harry Potter]] that she continued to feel sad about her mother's death from time to time and believed that she would see her again after death.<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

Luna apparently had a large photograph beside her bed at [[Lovegood House|home]] depicting her and her mother hugging. She was described as looking very much like her daughter.<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref> Many years later, Pandora Lovegood would posthumously become the maternal grandmother to [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]], the sons of Luna and [[Rolf Scamander]].<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL]] (Archived)</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Pandora closely resembled her daughter in appearance.<ref name="appearance"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
Pandora Lovegood was described as being an extraordinary [[Wizardkind|witch]] by her daughter Luna, implying she was very talented, skilled and creative in terms of her [[magic]]al abilities.<ref name="OOTP38"/>
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Pandora was noted to enjoy experimenting with and inventing new [[spell]]s, showing she was a powerful witch in her own right, as spell creation requires immense magical knowledge and skill. However, one of her experimental spells one day backfired and accidentally killed her.<ref name="OOTP38"/>

==Etymology==
''Pandora'' is of the Ancient Greek and derived from πᾶν (= pān) => i.e. "all" and δῶρον (= dōron) => "gift", thus ''"the all-endowed"'', ''"the all-gifted"'' or ''"the all-giving"''. ''Pandora'' is said to be the first woman created by the gods in Greek mythology. She was given a box by them, and was told never to open it. Pandora, known for her intense curiosity, opened the box releasing things such as misery, sadness, etc. into the world, hence the phrase "''do not open Pandora's box"''. This could relate to her experimenting with spells, thus her curiosity, and her death, the consequence.

''Lovegood'' is a real surname and a compound word (Love and Good). This could be translated to "loving the good" or "chivalry".
