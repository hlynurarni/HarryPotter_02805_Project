'''Geoffrey Hooper''' is a student who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and ended up in the [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. He tried out for the [[Gryffindor]] [[Keeper]] position in [[1995]]. He performed better during his trial than [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], but [[Angelina Johnson]] felt that Geoffrey was a whiner and complainer and thus Ron was selected for the position instead.<ref>{{OOTP|B|13}}</ref>

==Etymology==
