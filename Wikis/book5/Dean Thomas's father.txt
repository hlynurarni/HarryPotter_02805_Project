The '''biological father of [[Dean Thomas]]''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who abandoned his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Dean Thomas's mother|wife]] and infant son in a courageous effort to protect them from the [[Death Eaters]]. He was soon after murdered by the Death Eaters when he refused to join their cause. His widow, who was never told that her husband was a wizard, eventually remarried a [[Dean Thomas's stepfather|Muggle man]], who raised Dean as his own son.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040605120307/http://www.jkrowling.com:80/textonly/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=2 Dean Thomas's background] (Internet Archive of {{JKRS}})</ref>

When Dean realised he was a wizard at age eleven, his mother suspected that her first husband might have also been a wizard; however, not knowing for certain, [[Dean Thomas's mother|Mrs Thomas]] left Dean to grow up believing he may be [[Muggle-born]].<ref name="DH15">{{DH|B|15}}</ref>
