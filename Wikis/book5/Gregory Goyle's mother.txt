'''Mrs Goyle''' was the wife of [[Gregory Goyle's father|Mr Goyle]] and the mother of [[Gregory Goyle]], a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. When members of [[Dumbledore's Army]] [[hex]]ed her son into a large, oozing [[slug]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] joked that she would consider it an improvement on his appearance.<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref> It's unknown if she has any involvement with the [[Death Eaters]], though she most likely was not one herself as she was not seen with her husband during [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Return of Lord Voldemort|revival]], but she was still likely loyal to them and their [[Pure-blood supremacy|cause]].
