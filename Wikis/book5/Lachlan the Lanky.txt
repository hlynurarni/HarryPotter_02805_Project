'''Lachlan the Lanky''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] from an unknown period. A statue of him is located on the Seventh floor of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

[[Ronald Weasley]] once hid behind this statue to avoid being found by [[Fred and George Weasley]], whom he felt would tease him for trying out for the position of [[Keeper]] on the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]].<ref name="OP13">{{OOTP|B|13}}</ref>
