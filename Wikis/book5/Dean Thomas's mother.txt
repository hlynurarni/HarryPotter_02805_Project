'''Mrs Thomas''' was the mother of [[Dean Thomas]]. Though she was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], her [[Dean Thomas's father|first husband]] was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], but he never told her so, believing that not knowing the truth would keep her safe. He deserted Mrs Thomas when their son was still a small boy and was eventually murdered by [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="jkr">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221017/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=2 Dean Thomas's background] at {{JKRS}} (via the Internet Archive)</ref>

Mrs Thomas remarried a [[Dean Thomas' stepfather|Muggle man]] and had [[Dean Thomas' half-siblings|several children]] with him. The family lived in [[London]] and were described as having "a very happy home life".<ref name="jkr" />

When a [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|letter]] arrived for Dean from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1991]], Mrs Thomas considered the possibility that her first husband might have been a wizard, but, like her son, was never able to confirm this suspicion.<ref name="jkr" />

In [[1995]], Dean opted not to let his parents know about the murder of [[Cedric Diggory]], presumably because he worried they would withdraw him from Hogwarts.<ref>{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref>

Dean had to go into hiding in [[1997]] because he was unable to prove he was a [[half-blood]] to the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. Mrs Thomas and her second husband were not sure where their son had gone, and were deeply concerned, so the radio programme ''[[Potterwatch]]'' asked its listeners to contact the Thomases if they knew anything about Dean.<ref>{{DH|B|22}}</ref>
