'''Donaghan Tremlett''' (b. [[1972]]) was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who played [[bass]] for the popular wizarding band [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]]. 

==Biography==
[[File:Screen_shot_2011-01-19_at_11.09.31_PM.png|thumb|left|At the Yule Ball]]
===Early life===
Donaghan Tremlett was born in [[1972]] to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Tremlett family|parents]].<ref name="fwc" /> He started playing the bass guitar at some point in his childhood, and was noted to be talented at it during his Hogwarts years.<ref name="HM">{{HM|2|The Weird Sisters!}}</ref>

Donaghan began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1983]] or [[1984]].<ref>[http://harrypotter.tokenzone.com/set_2001/tokens/token_11.swf Flash card] from Harry Potter Magical Trading Cards</ref> During his Hogwarts years, he saw the [[Weird Sisters|The Weird Sisters]] perform their song ''[[Do the Hippogriff]]'' and auditioned to become the new bass player of the band. Donaghan became a member of the band, replacing [[Jacob's sibling]], as he could actually play the bass without the use of [[magic]].<ref name="HM"/>

===Later life===
On [[25 December|Christmas Day]] in [[1994]], the band attended the [[Yule Ball]] at Hogwarts,<ref name="gof23"> {{GOF|B|23}}</ref> where they played classic hits like "[[Magic Works]]" and "[[This Is the Night]]," as well as a new song titled "[[Do the Hippogriff]]."<ref>{{GOF|F}}</ref>

Donaghan married [[Donaghan Tremlett's wife|a woman]] in September [[1995]]. The wedding was mentioned in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' on [[7 September]].<ref>{{OOTP|B|14}} - "“No,” she sighed, “just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married. ...”"</ref>

After the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in September 1997, Donaghan, as a [[Muggle-born]], presumably faced charges before the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. He may have been sent to [[Azkaban]], or else gone into hiding, like many others of his heritage.

==Physical appearance==
Donaghan was described as "hairy"<ref name="hbp30" /> and, like all members of the Weird Sisters, wore "artfully torn" black robes when onstage.<ref name="gof23"> {{GOF|B|23}}</ref>
