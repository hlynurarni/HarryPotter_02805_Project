{{Quote|According to [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], [[thought]]s could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr Ubbly's Oblivious Unction there seemed to have been some improvement.|An example of how the unction heals scarring|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Dr Ubbly's Oblivious Unction''' was a [[Healing magic|medicinal]] [[potion]] given to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] by [[Poppy Pomfrey]] after he had been attacked by brains in the [[Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="OOTP38"/>

It proved mostly effective in healing the injuries caused by the brains' tentacles and thoughts,<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref> though several months later there was still at least some scarring left.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>
