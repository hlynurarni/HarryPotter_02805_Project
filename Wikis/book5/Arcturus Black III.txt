'''Arcturus Black''' {{OM|First}} ([[1901]] – [[1991]]) was a [[pure-blood]] wizard and member of the noble [[House of Black]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[1901]] as the eldest son of [[Sirius Black II|Sirius Black]] and his wife [[Hesper Gamp]]. His younger siblings were [[Lycoris Black|Lycoris]] and [[Regulus Black I|Regulus]].

He married [[Melania Macmillan]], who bore him a daughter, [[Lucretia Black|Lucretia]], and a son, [[Orion Black|Orion]]. Arcturus became a grandfather after Orion married their cousin [[Walburga Black|Walburga]] and had two sons, [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Regulus Black|Regulus]]. Lucretia had no children from her marriage to [[Ignatius Prewett]].

At some point, Arcturus<ref name="PMordermerlin">{{WW|order-of-merlin}}</ref> was awarded the [[Order of Merlin|Order of Merlin, First Class]], for "''Services to the Ministry''".<ref name="OP6">{{OOTP|B|6}}</ref> His grandson Sirius believed that he received the honour because he had given the Ministry a large amount of gold.<ref name="PMordermerlin" /><ref name="OP6" /> The medal was left at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] after his death; in [[1995]], Sirius found the medal while cleaning and threw it into a rubbish sack with contempt.<ref name="OP6" />

Arcturus died in [[1991]]. He had outlived both his siblings, his son, his daughter-in-law, and his younger grandson. He was survived by his daughter and his elder grandson.

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Arcturus may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, he attended Hogwarts c. [[1912]]-[[1919]], and Slughorn did not become the Potions master until approximately [[1931]].
*Arcturus' second grandson was named [[Regulus Black|Regulus Arcturus Black]]. Regulus was probably named in honour of his grandfather and his great-uncle, Arcturus's brother.
*On the Black family tree shown on {{OOTP|FA}}, Arcturus's name is misspelt as "Arctorus".

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Arcturus|Arcturus]] is the name of the brightest star in the constellation Boötes. Its name derives from Ancient Greek ''Αρκτοῦρος'', meaning "bear guard"; this refers to the story in Greek mythology that Zeus placed Arcturus in the sky to look after Arcas and Callisto, who were turned into [[bear]]s and then into the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor to protect them from Hera's wrath.
