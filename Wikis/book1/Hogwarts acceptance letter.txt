The '''Hogwarts letter''' is a letter of acceptance to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], sent to [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|wizards and witches]] prior to their [[first year]] at Hogwarts.<ref name="PS4"/><ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref> A [[Quill of Acceptance|special quill]] exists, which writes down the name of every magical child in [[Great Britain|Britain]] at the time of their birth. This allows Hogwarts letters to be sent to all magical children at the appropriate time, even those who are [[Muggle-born]].<ref name="PM">{{PM}}</ref>

The Hogwarts letter consists of a note of acceptance from the Deputy Headmaster or Headmistress of Hogwarts.<ref name="PS4"/> This note is written in green ink and is accompanied by a [[Shopping List|list]] of required textbooks and materials for the upcoming school year.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

==Letter delivery==
[[File:Hogwarts letters privet drive.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A bombardment of Hogwarts letters addressed to [[Harry Potter]]]]

The letter is written on parchment paper and delivered to the recipient by [[owl]], except in the case of [[Muggle-borns]]. When a student is Muggle-born the acceptance letter is delivered in person by a member of the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] faculty. The faculty member acts as a [[special messenger]], who explains everything to the student and parents.<ref name="DH33"/>

Harry Potter's initial acceptance letter was delivered by regular [[Muggle Mail|Muggle post]], as [[Vernon Dursley|Vernon]] and [[Petunia Dursley]] were aware of the existence of the [[wizarding world]] and Hogwarts.<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref> Hogwarts is able to magically tell whether or not a child has read his or her Hogwarts letter.<ref name="PS3"/><ref name="PS4"/> This was evidenced by the later bombardment of [[4 Privet Drive]] with letters via owl, despite at least one of them having been opened and read by Vernon and Petunia.<ref name="PS3"/>

==History==
Harry Potter first received one during the summer holidays of 1991. He was stunned at receiving such a letter, as he normally never received any correspondence, and held on to it. This caused [[Vernon Dursley]] to joke that he might be checking for [[letter bomb]]s. When Dudley discovered what the letter said, Vernon seized the letter and burned it.<ref name="PS3"/> Then he moved Harry to the [[Smallest Bedroom]].<ref name="PS3"/>  He went to increasingly elaborate measures to try to stop the delivery of the letters, eventually resulting in [[Rubeus Hagrid]] personally visiting the [[Hut-on-the-Rock]] to deliver the letter.<ref name="PS4"/>

[[File:Hogwarts letters burrow.jpg|250px|thumb|Hogwarts letters arrive at [[The Burrow]]]]

When Harry was rescued from the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] by Fred, George, and Ron Weasley Hogwarts knew to send his letter (containing his [[Shopping List|booklist]]) the Burrow, instead of 4 Privet Drive. His booklist arrived with the letters to every other student present within the house. This could have been because Dumbledore was informed that Harry was no longer with this relatives.<ref name="COS4">{{COS|B|4}}</ref><ref name="COSF">{{COS|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Screenshot_850.png|thumb|Harry reading his letter in {{PS|G}}]]
[[File:Hogwarts acceptance letter in PAS.png|thumb|right|A Hogwarts acceptance letter as seen in {{PAS}}]]
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, the letters come from additional places like the [[toaster]], [[washing machine]] and in between the windshield wipers on the way to the beach.
*In {{WWHP}}, customisable Hogwarts Acceptance Letters are sold, with the individual's name printed, along with a list of school supplies.
*On {{PM}}, the user is able to view Harry's Acceptance Letter in Chapter 4 (Keeper of the Keys), Moment 2 (Harry receives his Letter at last). Also, the Shopping List is viewable during the user's first encounter at [[Diagon Alley]] and is then placed in the user's trunk.
*It is a wide misconception that you receive the letter on your 11th birthday as [[Harry Potter|Harry]] received his first letter about a week before his birthday and most of the subsequent ones between then and his birthday, he happened to receive his final letter that he actually read through [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on his birthday.
**At the very least students who have August birthdays would need to receive their letters prior to their birthdays as the cut off date for confirming their places is July the 31st and they would also need time to get supplies.
**It is confirmed on Pottermore that [[Minerva McGonagall]] received her letter exactly on her birthday, meaning it does sometimes happen, though not always. 
*In the European Portuguese translation of {{PS}}, ''Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal'', "''[[caduceus|one caduceus]]''" is added to the list of required equipment.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|GBC version]] of {{PS}}, the letter is written as follows by Dumbledore:

:''<nowiki/>''
::''Dear Mr Potter, ''

::''You have been accepted to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].''

::''Yours sincerely,''

::''Albus Dumbledore''

::''Headmaster''
