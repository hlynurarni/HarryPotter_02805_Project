'''[[Quirinus Quirrell]]'s second [[Mountain Troll|mountain troll]]''' was a [[troll]] used to guard the [[Philosopher's Stone]] during the [[1991–1992 school year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

==History==
It was the obstacle of [[Quirinus Quirrell]] in the [[Underground Chambers]]. It was in between [[Minerva McGonagall]]'s [[Chessboard Chamber|giant chess set]] and [[Severus Snape]]'s [[Underground Chambers#Sixth obstacle|potion riddle]].<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

On [[4 June]] [[1992]], after [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] mastered the Chessboard, they entered the room containing this troll, only to find it completely knocked out with a [[blood]]y stump on its head. They were both very glad to have avoided facing the troll themselves, allowing them to continue with their quest.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the book and GBC video game, the troll has already collapsed on the floor when Harry and Hermione get there, courtesy of Quirrell. However, in the PS1 game adaptation, the troll wakes up when Harry and Hermione get there. The troll is still groggy so while Hermione tries to unlock the next door, Harry [[Levitation Charm|levitates]] the litter present in the room from out of the troll's way, without making noise. The troll doesn't notice a hole on the floor and falls into it.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref>
*The troll and the room it guards is completely omitted from {{PS|FA}}.
