'''Garrick Ollivander''' (b. [[25 September]],<ref name="pottermore" /> pre [[1908]])<ref name="yearage" />) was a [[half-blood]]<ref name="pottermore" /> [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the proprietor of [[Ollivanders]] in [[Diagon Alley]] during most of the [[20th century]]. Ollivander was widely considered the best [[wandmaker]] in the world, and many [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] bought their [[wand]]s from him.

In [[1996]], Ollivander was captured and [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. He was rescued in [[1998]] by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Dobby]]. He imparted important information regarding [[wandlore]] to Harry, it helped him in his understanding of the [[Deathly Hallows]].

==Biography==
===Family heritage===
{{Main|Ollivander family}}

Ollivander's family had long been associated with the profession of [[Wandlore|wandcraft]]. The surname means 'he who owns the olive wand' which is of [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] origin, suggesting that the family emigrated to Britain from elsewhere. Mr Ollivander believes that his ancestors arrived in Britain with the Romans and set up a stall and eventually a shop, to sell newer and improved wands to British wizards who had poorly constructed wands that were unreliable.<ref name="pm" />

===Early life===
Garrick Ollivander was born to [[Gervaise Ollivander]],<ref name="wandwoods">{{WW|wand-woods}}</ref> a wizard, and his [[Garrick Ollivander's mother|wife]], a [[Muggle-born]] witch,<ref name="pottermore" /> on the [[25 September]],<ref name="pottermore" /> in or before the year [[1907]].<ref name="yearage" />

He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, where he was Sorted into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]].<ref name="pottermore" />

===Career as a wandmaker===
{{Quote|Renowned wandmaker Mr Ollivander owns the wand shop Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands Since 382 BC in Diagon Alley. His shop is widely considered the best place to purchase a wand.|Description|Pottermore}}

[[File:Harry-potter1-ollivander.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Ollivander holding one of the many wands inside his shop]]

Ollivander grew up in the family business and showed precocious talent in [[wandlore|wandmaking]]. Soon, he developed an ambition to improve upon the cores and wand woods he made and developed a determination to pursue the ideal wand.<ref name="pottermore" />

Before Garrick Ollivander's proprietorship of [[Ollivanders]], wizards used a wide variety of wand cores; the customer would often present their [[wandmaker]] with a magical substance to which they were attached, and he would turn it into their wand core.<ref name="pottermore" /> Mr Ollivander believed that doing so altered the wand's temperament,<ref name="GOF18">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref> and he revolutionised the way [[wand]]s were crafted by having cores of immensely powerful magical substances expertly enclosed in specially selected and complementary [[Wand wood|wandwoods]], with the result being that the wand would be matched to an owner that the wand itself felt an affinity for.<ref name="pottermore" />

[[File:Sorcerers-stone-ollivander.jpg|234x234px|thumb|Ollivander talking with a customer]]

While there was initially substantial resistance to this new way wands were made, it soon became clear that wands made by Ollivander were far superior to any others. His methods of locating wand woods and core substances, marrying them together, and matching them to ideal owners were all jealously guarded secrets that were coveted by rival wandmakers.<ref name="pottermore" />

Sometime into his career, in the summer of [[1938]], Ollivander sold [[Tom Riddle]] his [[Tom Riddle's wand|wand]].<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

Shortly before the [[1984–1985 school year]], Ollivander sold a wand to a [[Jacob's sibling|soon-to-be student]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], just as he did with [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|their brother]] before them.<ref>{{HM|1|1}}</ref>

As with other wandmakers, Ollivander made it his business to study the mystifying [[Elder Wand]] in depth, such as its history and distinctive characteristics. Unlike [[Hermione Granger]], he believed that the Elder Wand was not a myth or tale, and showed great enthusiasm with the powerful object despite the fact that it was dangerous and has had a bloody history. When held captive by Lord Voldemort, he was forced to relate all information he had known about the powerful wand. He also revealed that the last person rumoured to own the wand was [[Mykew Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], a foreign wandmaker, though he did not believe the rumour and thought that Gregorovitch spread it to boost his business.<ref name="DH24" />

====Harry Potter's wand====
{{Quote|Ah yes. Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter. You have your [[Lily J. Potter|mother]]’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.|Ollivander greeting Harry Potter for the first time in his shop|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Harry-potter1-ollivander_harry.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Mr Ollivander presents [[Harry Potter]] with his first wand]]

Ollivander supplied [[Harry Potter]] with a [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]], and as he did so, he told Harry a few facts about wands. He explained that a wand has a [[wand core|core]], in Harry's case a [[phoenix]] [[Phoenix feather|feather]]. He told Harry that the body of the wand is made from a choice of different [[wand wood|woods]] with different magical properties. Ollivander said he made a similar wand using another feather from the [[Fawkes|same phoenix]], but using a different wood. Harry's wand is [[holly]], which symbolises protection, rather than Voldemort's [[yew]], which is symbolic of death. He also explained that the wand chooses the wizard, rather than the other way around.<ref name="PS5" /> Immediately after Harry left the shop, Ollivander sent a [[Garrick Ollivander's letter to Albus Dumbledore|letter]] to [[Albus Dumbledore]] informing him of the wand's sale.<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>

====1994-1995 Triwizard Tournament====
{{Quote|May I introduce Mr Ollivander? He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.|[[Wand weighing ceremony]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

[[File:Harry-potter1-ollivander2.jpg|250px|thumb|Ollivander behind the desk in his wand shop]]

On [[13 November]], [[1994]] Ollivander presided over the [[Wand weighing ceremony]] during the [[Triwizard Tournament]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref>{{GOF|B|18}} - "He had already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore them, ignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he couldn’t see why today should be any better."<br/>The weighing of the wands was during Double Potions on the second Friday after Harry's name comes out the the Goblet of Fire on Hallowee'en, which was Saturday 31 October.</ref> As a very recognised wandmaker, Ollivander was asked to inspect the wands of the champions in the [[1994-1995 school year|1994-1995]] [[Triwizard Tournament]] before the competition started, to make sure they were all working properly. While he found no problems with any of the wands' performance, he expressed doubts of [[Mykew Gregorovitch]]'s styling of [[Viktor Krum]]'s [[Viktor Krum's wand|wand]] and the use of [[Veela hair]] as a core in [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Fleur Delacour's wand|wand]].<ref name="GOF18" />

===Second Wizarding War===
====Attempted robbery of his shop====
In [[1996]], [[Alexandra Walker]] attempted to rob [[Ollivanders]]. She could not, however, and she was arrested. This event made ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' headlines.<ref>{{OOTP|F}}</ref>

====Kidnapped by Death Eaters====
{{Dialogue a-b-c|Arthur Weasley|Shop's empty. No sign of a struggle.

[[File:Ollivanderkidded.PNG|245x245px|thumb|left|Fenrir Greyback and other Death Eaters kidnap Ollivander from outside of his shop]]

In [[July]] [[1996]], Ollivander was kidnapped by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]], leaving behind an empty, locked up shop and no signs of a struggle.<ref name="HBP6">{{HBP|B|6}}</ref> It is believed that [[Neville Longbottom's second wand|one of the last wands]] he sold was to [[Neville Longbottom]], as he disappeared the next day.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref> Ollivander was captured by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters and was held prisoner at [[Malfoy Manor]], where he was forced to make a [[Peter Pettigrew's wand|new wand]] for [[Peter Pettigrew]].<ref name="DH24">{{DH|B|24}}</ref> He was [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] by Lord Voldemort for information regarding the [[Reverse Spell|twin cores]] of [[Harry Potter]]'s wand and his own. Ollivander told him that he merely needed to use a wand other than his own to face Harry Potter.<ref name="HBP5">{{HBP|B|5}}</ref>

After using [[Lucius Malfoy]]'s [[Lucius Malfoy's wand|wand]] and seeing its destruction when faced with Harry Potter and his Phoenix wand, Voldemort rounded on Ollivander for an explanation of why Harry's wand acted as it had. Although he had no answer to give since no wandmaker had ever witnessed such an event, Ollivander was tortured again by Lord Voldemort and questioned about the most powerful wand in existence, the [[Elder Wand]].<ref name="DH24" />

====Skirmish at Malfoy Manor and escape====
{{Main|Skirmish at Malfoy Manor}}

[[File:06_Dobby_rescuing_Mr._Ollivander_and_Luna_Lovegood.jpg|244x244px|thumb|Ollivander and Luna are saved from Malfoy Manor by [[Dobby]] the House-Elf]]

Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Dean Thomas and Griphook, were later captured and taken to Malfoy Manor, where they were reunited with Mr Ollivander and [[Luna Lovegood]]. While in the cellar Harry noted that Ollivander was not looking well, due to being repeatedly tortured for a long period of time. Ollivander and the others were subsequently rescued by [[Dobby]] the [[House-Elf]] in the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|Skirmish]].<ref name="DH23">{{DH|B|23}}</ref> Ollivander seemed to have bonded with Luna during their captivity together, and thanked her for being ''"an inexpressible comfort ''[to him]'' in that terrible place"''.

====Stay at Shell Cottage====

[[File:Mr._Ollivander_inside_the_Shell_Cottage.JPG|251x251px|thumb|left|Ollivander at Shell Cottage after being rescued from Malfoy Manor explaining about the [[Elder Wand]] to [[Harry Potter]]]]

Ollivander was taken to [[Shell Cottage]], where he recovered from months of imprisonment and torture. While at Shell Cottage he was interrogated by Harry Potter who wanted to know information about the [[Elder Wand]] that Voldemort was so obsessively searching for and to have a better understanding of the unique connection that existed between his wand and Voldemort's.<ref name="DH24" /> He later departed to [[Muriel]]'s house, where he remained in hiding for the rest of the war.<ref name="DH25">{{DH|B|25}}</ref> He later crafted and sent a [[Luna Lovegood's second wand|new wand]] to Luna Lovegood.<ref name="DH26">{{DH|B|26}}</ref> Although Ollivander's fate after Voldemort's final defeat is unknown, it can be assumed he most likely returned to his shop and business once the Second Wizarding War ended.

During the 2010s, Ollivander appeared as a [[Foundable]] during the [[Calamity]]. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] were able to free him, allowing Ollivander to return to his original time.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.|Harry Potter meeting Ollivander|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
When first meeting him, Harry Potter described Garrick Ollivander as an old man with pale silvery eyes and white skin.<ref name="eyes"/><ref name="skin"/> However, after he was kidnapped by Voldemort's Death Eaters, Ollivander's appearance changed for the worse as a result of the torture and abuse he suffered at the hands of Voldemort. After he was rescued, he was described to be emaciated, with yellow skin, his facial bones sticking out, skeleton-like hands, and vast, sunken eyes.<ref name="DH24"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — why, its brother gave you that scar.|Ollivander's excellent memory and deep knowledge of wands|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Olivander.png|229x229px|thumb|Ollivander and his many wands]]
Ollivander was an intelligent man, with a perfect memory when it came to his work; he remembered the details of every wand he ever sold. He seemed to become happier the more difficult the challenge to find exactly the right wand for a difficult customer was. He used a magical [[Garrick Ollivander's tape measure|tape measure]] to help assess customers for their wand.<ref name="PS5"/>

Ollivander had a professorial enthusiasm for wandlore and was immensely learned in it. A less savoury aspect of his personality was that his fascination with wandlore sometimes eclipsed his sense of right and wrong; he was so fascinated with what a powerful wizard can do when matched with the right wand that he became detached from the good or evil nature of their actions. A prime example of this would be [[Tom Riddle]], who became Lord Voldemort. Even after the [[First Wizarding War]], Ollivander remembered him as having done "great things" with his wand — "''terrible, yes, but great''".<ref name="PS5"/> An even more extreme example was during the [[Second Wizarding War]], when Ollivander, having just been rescued from a year of imprisonment and torture at Voldemort's hands, was briefly enthralled by the thought of what Voldemort might do when matched with the [[Elder Wand]].<ref name="DH24"/>

However, Ollivander still valued his own life and well-being, and divulged information to Voldemort whenever threatened with [[death]] and tortured by the Cruciatus Curse.<ref name="DH24"/> The wandmaker feared the Dark Lord's wrath and begged for mercy when informed that his (Ollivander's) advice about using another wand was incorrect.

==Magical abilities and skills==

*'''[[Wandmaker|Wandmaking]]/[[Wandlore]]''': Garrick Ollivander, just as other Ollivander family members, was considered as the best British wand-maker, with an immense knowledge of wandlore. He was very knowledgeable of the different magical properties possessed by different wands, in particular relation to their [[Wand wood|woods]] and [[Wand core|cores]].<ref name="PS5"/><ref name="GOF18"/><ref name="DH24"/>
*'''[[Non-verbal magic]]''': Ollivander had the ability to perform non-verbal spells, as no incantation was spoken by him when he conjured [[Smokescreen Spell|smoke rings]] in 1994. Given the high level of difficulty required in the casting of spells non-verbally, this shows he was a wizard of very impressive magical skills.<ref name="GOF18"/>   
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most accomplished adult wizards, he could Apparate, but failed in 1998 at Malfoy Manor due to [[Anti-Disapparition Jinx|enchantments]] placed on the cellar.<ref name="DH23"/>
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': He was skilled with [[conjuration]], a highly difficult and complex branch of transfiguration, conjuring [[Orchideous|flowers]], [[Bird-Conjuring Charm|birds]], smoke rings, and [[Fountain of wine|wine]] in 1994.<ref name="GOF18"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Ollivander was able to produce a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm]],<ref name="LEGOY1"/><ref name="LEGOY2"/> a mark of superior [[magic]]al ability given the immense difficulty required in the casting of the spell. He was also proficient with the [[Knockback Jinx]].<ref name="PSG"/>
*'''[[Wand]] versatility''': In [[1994]], Ollivander used Cedric's, Fleur's, Viktor's and Harry's wands, each with successful effect.<ref name="GOF18"/>
*'''Eidetic memory''': Ollivander was able to recite the precise details of every wand he ever crafted or sold. This eidetic — or photographic — memory of these details borders on perfect recall, a very rare ability.<ref name="PS5"/>
*'''Business''': Ollivander also possessed excellent business skills, being highly able to successfully operate and manage his own wand shop for at least sixty years.<ref name="PS5"/>

==Possessions==

==Relationships==
===Harry Potter===
{{Quote|I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you, Mr Potter.|Ollivander to Harry during their first meeting|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)}}
[[File:Harry Potter.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Harry Potter]], a good friend]] 
Like most of the [[wizarding world]], Ollivander heard of Harry Potter and his [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|defeat]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in 1981. He first met Harry in 1991 and sold him his [[Harry Potter's wand|wand]]. The [[phoenix feather]] in [[Harry Potter's wand|Harry's]] and [[Tom Riddle's wand|Riddle's]] wands came from the same phoenix, [[Fawkes]], something that Ollivander considered "curious". However, Harry was unsure whether he liked Ollivander due to the wandmaker's fascination by what Voldemort did with his wand, despite the terrible things he did with it.<ref name="PS5"/>

Ollivander's relationship with [[Harry Potter]] grew after the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]] when Harry rescued him from imprisonment and during their subsequent stay at the [[Shell Cottage]]. Harry would go on to obtain vital information about the [[Elder Wand]] from Ollivander, which would later prove instrumental for bringing about the final defeat of Lord Voldemort.<ref name="DH24"/>

===Luna Lovegood===
{{Dialogue a-b|Luna Lovegood|I'm going to miss you, Mr Ollivander.|Ollivander|And I you, my dear. You were an inexpressible comfort to me in [[Malfoy Manor|that terrible place]].|Luna says goodbye to Mr Ollivander|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File: Luna Lovegood.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Luna Lovegood]], a good friend]]
Ollivander also developed a close relationship with Luna Lovegood, for she was a comfort to him during their imprisonment in Malfoy Manor. Ollivander later repaid her kindness to him by creating a new wand for her.<ref name="DH24"/>

===Lord Voldemort===
{{Quote|He tortured me, you must understand that! The [[Cruciatus Curse]], I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed — |Ollivander regarding how Voldemort tortured him to procure information about the [[Elder Wand]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Voldemort Headshot DHP1.png|150px|thumb|right|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], a feared enemy]]
Ollivander was very much afraid of Lord Voldemort, and referred to him as "You-Know-Who" like almost all other wizards. He was kidnapped by [[Death Eaters]] and [[Cruciatus Curse|tortured]] by Voldemort for information about Voldemort's wand's relationship with Harry's wand, which further developed his fear of the Dark Lord.<ref name="DH24"/> However, despite his intense fear and hatred of Voldemort, Ollivander was nevertheless fascinated by what Voldemort did both with his phoenix wand and the Elder Wand.<ref name="PS5"/>

*Garrick Ollivander is played by the late [[John Hurt]] in {{PS|FA}}, {{DH|FA1}} and {{DH|FA2}}. He was originally set to appear in the {{GOF|FA}}<ref>[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/hurt-to-return-as-ollivander-in-goblet-of-fire-13201/ Snitchseeker.com: Hurt to return as Ollivander in Goblet of Fire]</ref> but the character's scenes were cut from the final film and have not been released.
*Ollivander is one of the only people before {{PS}} who knew Voldemort's real name. He said in the first book he knows that Voldemort's wand caused Harry's scar. While this is not stated in any explicit way, the very fact that Voldemort has only ever had one wand (except for his use of the wand of [[Lucius Malfoy]] and the [[Elder Wand]] very late in life) would ensure that Ollivander would have sold him a wand at age 11, when he still used his former name. It is possible that he somehow deduced the secret sometime before July 1991, be it through mere deduction or that Dumbledore himself told him, since Dumbledore did say that Ollivander contacted him to tell him that Harry had bought the only other wand in existence crafted with one of Fawkes's feathers. He might simply have recognised the wand in the hands of Lord Voldemort.

*Ollivander's first name, Garrick, was revealed via his shop in {{PM}}.
*In {{DH}}, Ollivander has no knowledge of the term "Deathly Hallows", being only aware of the Elder Wand, but not of its status as one of these fabled objects. In the film adaptation, {{DH|F2}}, however, he is fully aware of the legend and even provides some information about it not provided by [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]. He denies the tale having any truth, however, until Harry forces him to admit that he told Voldemort about the Elder Wand.
*Originally published on {{PM}} and later transferred to {{WW}}, there is a feature called "5 things we learned from wise Mr Ollivander" that highlights facts about wandlore.<ref>''[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/5-things-we-learned-from-wise-mr-ollivander 5 things we learned from wise Mr Ollivander]'' at {{WW}}</ref>
