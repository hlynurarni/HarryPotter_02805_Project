{{Quote|The Mirror of Erised is an ancient, ornate mirror. It has clawed feet and a gold frame inscribed with the phrase " ''Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi''." The mirror shows the most desperate desire of a person's heart, a vision that has been known to drive men mad.|Description|Pottermore}}
'''The Mirror of Erised''' was a [[magic]]al mirror, which, according to [[Albus Dumbledore]], shows the "''deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts''." The name "Erised" is "desire" spelled backwards, as if reflected in a [[mirror]]. The happiest and most satisfied person in the world would look in the mirror and see a reflection of them, exactly as they were, for they would then have no one and nothing more to yearn or desire for that the mirror could ever show them. But of course, it is intrinsically inherent for [[human]] nature to desire something greater than one's own self - meaning that an event wherein the mirror fails to carry out its intended purpose rarely, if at all, happens.<ref name="PS">{{PS|B|12}}</ref> 
The writing engraved on the frame of the mirror was supposedly in a foreign and probably dead language, but if one looked closely it said "''I show not your face but your heart's desire''" backwards, with the spaces rearranged. ''Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.''<ref name="PS"/>

==History==
===Early history===
{{Quote|Men have wasted away before it, not knowing if what they have seen is real, or even possible.|Albus Dumbledore explaining the danger of the mirror to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}The Mirror of Erised was created before the end of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]]. It is unknown who the creator was. The mirror is one of those magical artefacts that seems to have been created in a spirit of fun (whether innocent or malevolent is a matter of opinion), because while it is much more revealing than a normal mirror, it is interesting rather than useful.<ref name="pottermore"/>

Indeed, it became grimly apparent over the years that the mirror could bring more harm than good; many wasted their lives before the mirror, losing track of reality as they were deluded by what they saw and unable or unwilling to accept it as mere fantasy. Some were even driven mad by seeing their most desperate desire presented before them as a mere image confined within the frames of the mirror, unable to achieve what they are witnessing.
It is unknown how it came to be at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. A succession of teachers have brought back interesting artefacts from their travels, so it might have arrived at the castle in this casual manner, either because the teacher knew how it worked and was intrigued by it, or because they did not understand it and wished to ask their colleagues' opinions.<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|the-mirror-of-erised}} (transcription available [http://lady-slytherin-forever.tumblr.com/post/8980253987/mirror-of-erised-pottermore here])</ref> The Mirror had been kept in the [[Room of Requirement]] since around 1891.<ref name="pottermore" />
[[File:Dumbledore Mirror of Erised.gif|220x220px|thumb|left|Albus Dumbledore standing in front of the mirror and seeing his former best friend and lover, Gellert Grindelwald]]
In [[September]] of [[1927]], the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] looked into the mirror and saw his former best friend, [[Gellert Grindelwald]], indicating he still has lingering [[Love|feelings]] for him, as well an old [[memory]] of himself and Grindelwald in a barn where they made a [[blood pact]]; swearing an oath never to fight each other, showing that Albus still valued that memory, manifested before him by the mirror as his greatest desire, of the time when his friendship with Gellert was at its strongest that led to the two of them cementing it with the pact in the first place.<ref name="COG73">{{COG|S|73}}</ref>

64 years later, in 1991, Dumbledore, now headmaster, had brought it out, and, tucking it out of sight in a [[disused classroom]], initiated some key modifications to the mirror, so that it could hide the [[Philosopher's Stone]].<ref name="pottermore" />

===1991-1992===
{{Quote|It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.|Albus Dumbledore, when he discovers that Harry has been using the Mirror|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}[[File:Harry sees parents in Mirror of Erised.gif|220x220px|thumb|Harry Potter standing in front of the mirror and seeing himself with his dead parents, Lily and James]]
The Mirror was discovered by [[Harry Potter]] on the night that he used his father's [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]] for the first time, to search the restricted section of the library for information about [[Nicolas Flamel]]. In his attempt to stay hidden from [[Argus Filch]], the school [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]], he stumbled upon the classroom where the mirror was being stored. Upon looking into it, Harry saw his late parents, Lily and James Potter. On his next midnight visit to the mirror, he brought [[Ronald Weasley]], hoping to show him his family. However, Ron saw himself as the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Gryffindor Quidditch Captain]] and [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]], holding up the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]], as he has always been overshadowed by his brothers and is always striving to be noticed by others.<ref name="PS">{{PS|B|12}}</ref>

[[File:Dumbledore talking to Harry about the Mirror of Erised.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Dumbledore advising Harry from seeking out the Mirror of Erised again]]

Over the next few days, Harry proceeded to visit it as often as he could to see [[James and Lily Potter|his parents]]' faces; the Mirror also occupied his thoughts beyond anything else, to the extent that he disregarded Ron's warning that he was growing obsessed with it. Dumbledore found Harry visiting the mirror one night, and after explaining to Harry what the mirror was all about, told him that the mirror was to be moved and requested that Harry not go looking for it. Before heading back to bed, Harry asked [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] what he saw when he looked into the mirror. Dumbledore claimed to see himself holding a pair of thick, woollen [[socks]], telling Harry that "''one can never have enough socks''."<ref name="PS">{{PS|B|12}}</ref> If this had been true, it would suggest that Dumbledore was so content with life that the only things he wished for were small things. However, Dumbledore was lying — the matter being a very personal one. Unbeknownst to Harry, for a long time, Dumbledore’s greatest desire was to be with his former lover, Gellert Grindelwald. But, by 1998, as revealed to Harry, Dumbledore, having come to terms with his guilt over his sister’s death, saw his family whole and intact, free of any pain or suffering.<ref name="DH">{{DH|B|35}}</ref> It is unknown if Grindelwald, as a redeemed man, was included in these later reflections.

{{Quote|He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — he’d gotten the Stone.|Harry gaining the Philosopher's stone by looking into the Mirror of Erised|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Harry sees himself with Philosopher's Stone in Mirror of Erised.gif|220x220px|thumb|Harry standing in front of the mirror and seeing himself holding the Philosopher's Stone]]
In 1992, the Mirror was the final guardian of the Philosopher's Stone in its [[Philosopher's Stone Chambers|Chambers]]. Dumbledore placed an [[Albus Dumbledore's unidentified charm on the Mirror of Erised|enchantment]] on the mirror, hiding the stone inside of it, and allowing the mirror to transfer the stone only to one who wanted to find the stone but not to use it. Anybody wishing more than simply to find it would see themselves making gold or the [[Elixir of Life]], or in [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]'s case presenting the stone to his master. This is because the greatest desire of anyone wanting to use the stone would not have their greatest desire to be finding it in the first place; anyone just wanting to find the stone but not use it would thus have their greatest desire to find the stone thus have their wish granted.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

When Professor Quirrell ordered Harry to look into the mirror, Harry focused on finding the stone, and, uninterested in actually using the stone for his own purposes, saw his reflection pocketing the stone, at which time it magically appeared in his real pocket.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

It is not known what happened to the mirror after these events. It might have stayed in the chamber or returned to its classroom.

During the [[Calamity]] which mysteriously happened across the [[Wizarding world]] in the [[2010]]s, the Mirror of Erised was one of the numerous [[magic]]al artefacts and items that were displayed across the world as [[Foundable]]s. Volunteer [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] had to cast [[spell]]s to banish the [[Confoundable]]s guarding them, to return the Foundables to their rightful places of belonging.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Powers==
{{Quote|Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?|Albus Dumbledore explaining the Mirrors powers to Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
The Mirror shows the greatest desire of the one looking into it upon its surface, often with them having achieved some goal or ambition. However, since each person is unique, only they can likewise see it from their point of view and no one else. According to [[Albus Dumbledore]], the Mirror shows neither truth nor knowledge (though it can if the subject being or question what is is it that the person most desires), and some have in fact gone mad from staring at it. Additionally, in time what a person sees in the Mirror can change, if that person's greatest desire changes.<ref name="PS"/> Dumbledore later [[Albus Dumbledore's unidentified charm on the Mirror of Erised|bewitched]] the Mirror to hold the [[Philosopher's Stone]], where the only one who could retrieve it from the Mirror would be one who wanted to find the Stone but not use it or have it used.<ref name="PS17"/>

==Etymology==
The word "Erised" (pronounced ''eer-eh-said'') is "desire" spelled backwards, meaning the name could also be known as the "Mirror of Desire". The backwards spelling symbolises how mirror reflections flip images around (for example, "erised" when reflected in a mirror spells "desire"). However, because this is no ordinary mirror, the text also shows how the mirror is very different from standard mirrors, in the way that it shows the inner desires and not the outside appearance of a person.

[[File:Mirror of Erised WU.png|thumb|The Mirror of Erised as seen in {{WU}}]]
*Albus Dumbledore lied to Harry Potter in 1991 about what he saw in the Mirror.
*The quote "Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi" on the mirror mentioned by Dumbledore reversed is "ishow no tyo urfac ebu tyo urhe arts desire", which with proper spacing becomes "I show not your face but your heart's desire".
*The Mirror of Erised can probably be considered to be an [[enchanted mirror]], albeit an unparalleled advanced one.
*Contrary to Dumbledore's words, the mirror does give its users knowledge, as it shows them what they want the most, even if they do not know for certain. Stranger still, it is implied that the picture of his family [[Harry Potter]] saw in the mirror was accurate, even though he could not possibly have known what his grandparents and other distant relatives looked like beforehand.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Ron sees himself in a [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] uniform while receiving a kiss on the cheek from [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name="LEGO">{{LEGO|Y1}}</ref>
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, when Harry touches Quirrell's/[[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s face and vanquishes him, his parents applaud in the mirror. When Harry is knocked unconscious and Voldemort's disembodied [[soul]] fails to grab the stone, his parents laugh at Voldemort's defeat.<ref name="LEGO">{{LEGO|Y1}}</ref>
*In {{DH|F2}}, when Harry finds the lost diadem in the [[Room of Requirement]], [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] (along with [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] and [[Blaise Zabini|Blaise]]) stands in the way of Harry's progress. Behind them the mirror can be seen among a pile of other hidden objects. Thus, it is quite obvious it was destroyed with everything else in the room by Goyle's spell, unless the prop was being reused as an easter egg for the fans. Neither is yet to have been confirmed.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{PS}}, the mirror is shown with the ability to reflect [[spell]]s, which is often used as a way to defeat [[Quirinus Quirrell|Quirrell]]/[[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]; how this often occurs varies:
**In the PC and GBA versions of ''The Philosopher's Stone'', Harry must use the proper side of the mirror itself to deflect Quirrell's spells back at him in the second phase of the battle. In both cases, he must cast the [[Knockback Jinx]] on it to orient it properly.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref>
**The PS2, Xbox and Gamecube versions instead involve having Harry stay close to the mirror, with Quirrell deeming that its power is protecting him; this is indicated with a white trail of magic connecting Harry to the mirror if he stays within a certain range of it, allowing him to absorb Quirrell's main offensive spell with no damage and to fire it back at him.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref>
**The PS1 version instead, involves Harry charging the mirror with a spell cast at it; a second one right after fires a beam straight from it that can damage Quirrell, but the mirror is unable to be oriented and Quirrell must be in proper position.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref>
**However, the only exceptions so far are in the GBC version of the game and in {{LEGO|Y1}}, where Quirrell is engaged in direct combat with the mirror having no involvement in the battle.<ref name="LEGO">{{LEGO|Y1}}</ref>
*In [[2003]], [[J. K. Rowling]] said that she would probably see herself as she is in the Mirror, because she had had another child, David Rowling Murray, just a few months before. She also added that she would like to see her mother alive again, and would hope that "''there'd be room over ''[her]'' shoulder to see a scientist inventing a cigarette that would be healthy''" and "''a particular journalist being boiled in oil.''"<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm "Fry, Stephen, interviewer: J.K. Rowling at the Royal Albert Hall, 26 June 2003"] at [http://www.accio-quote.org/index.html Accio Quote]</ref>
*The Mirror is possibly inspired by the magic mirrors in classic fairy tales such as ''Snow White'', in which the desire of the story's antagonist, The Queen, is to be the fairest in the kingdom.
*The scene where Harry sees his parents in the mirror for the first time makes an appearance in {{OOTP|FA}} during Harry's [[Occlumency]] lessons with Snape.
*The Mainland Chinese version of {{PS}} included various footnotes from the translator explaining various aspects of British culture to Chinese readers. The footnote for the Mirror of Erised's inscription incorrectly claims that it is a secret [[Wikipedia:Taoism|Taoist]] charm.
*The Mirror of Erised can be considered the polar opposite of a [[Boggart]]; though both have identical abilities, the Mirror shows the person's deepest desire while a Boggart shows their deepest fear. They are, of course, set apart by the fact that Boggarts are a type of [[creature]], whereas the Mirror is merely an object, which has never shown any sort of personality or personal volition.
*In {{COG}}, the Mirror of Erised depicts both [[Albus Dumbledore]] together with [[Gellert Grindelwald]] and the two of them forming their [[blood pact]], despite the latter simply being a re-enactment of something which had already happened, rather than something which Dumbledore desired. Though it is possible that the mirror reflected the desire of being in a similar situation again. 

===Author's comments===
"''Albus Dumbledore's words of caution to Harry when discussing the Mirror of Erised express my own views. The advice to 'hold on to your dreams' is all well and good, but there comes a point when holding on to your dreams becomes unhelpful and even unhealthy. Dumbledore knows that life can pass you by while you are clinging on to a wish that can never be - or ought never to be - fulfilled. Harry's deepest yearning is for something impossible: the return of his parents. Desperately sad though it is that he has been deprived of his family, Dumbledore knows that to sit gazing on a vision of what he can never have, will only damage Harry. The mirror is bewitching and tantalising, but it does not necessarily bring happiness''."
