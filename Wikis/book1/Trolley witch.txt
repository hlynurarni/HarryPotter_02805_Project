The '''Trolley witch''' (b. before [[1830]]) was an elderly [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was one of the two known crew members aboard the [[Hogwarts Express]] on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]],<ref name="PS6"/><ref name="PA5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref> She came around during the middle of the journey, pushing the "[[Honeydukes Express]]" cart, with lots of confectionery goods to purchase. She also oversaw the [[Buffet Car]] during the voyage.<ref name="GBA">{{POA|G}} - GBA version</ref>

==Biography==
{{Quote|Anything sweet for you, dear?|Trolley lady to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)}}
She was hired around [[1830]] by [[Ottaline Gambol]]. She claimed to have made around six million [[Pumpkin Pasty|Pumpkin Pasties]] and revealed to [[Albus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]] that she secretly made them into mini grenades. She then threw one to prove it. She also claimed to have done something to [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s too. She stated that people buy her food but never really notice her and that she couldn't recall the last time someone asked her name, something which she herself has even forgotten.<ref name="CC" />

In [[1991]], she sold many sweets to [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]] aboard the [[Hogwarts Express]], as they travelled on the train for the first time to Hogwarts.<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

In [[1993]], she provided [[Cauldron Cake]]s to Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and [[Hermione Granger]]. When they tried and failed to wake [[Professor]] [[Remus Lupin]], noting that he looked like he could do with food, she kindly noted that she would be up front with the [[Hogwarts Express conductor|conductor]] if Lupin were to wake.<ref name="PA5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref>

In [[1997]], she attended the [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]].<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

In [[2019]], she was whisked away by The Calamity just shortly prior to the Hogwarts Express's scheduled departure on 1 September. [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] quickly solicited the assistance of a reputable member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] that Hermione Granger had recommended, who successfully returned her in time for the new [[2019–2020 school year|school year]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: Back to Hogwarts"</ref>

She apprehended Albus and Scorpius when they tried to get off the [[Hogwarts Express]], stating that others such as [[Sirius Black]] and [[Marauders|his cronies]], and [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] had tried before but failed. She told them that the train does not take too kindly to students trying to get off it before it reaches its destination, and Transfigured her hands into claws to scare them. She then asked them to go back to their seats. When the two nevertheless escaped, she was highly embarrassed.<ref name="CC" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Don’t worry, dear, If he’s hungry when he wakes, I’ll be up front with the driver.|The witch's kind demeanour|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
[[File:Trolley Witch Cursed Child.png|250px|thumb|right|The trolley witch tries to prevent the escape of [[Albus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]]]]
The witch was elderly and slightly hunchback. She was however, a solemn but kind person, treating and serving all the passengers of the [[Hogwarts Express]] equally and kindly.<ref name="PS6"/> However, she would become upset when students would try to get off the train and would turn more sinister, [[Transfiguration|Transfiguring]] her hands into claws to scare them, in order for them to sit back in their seats, showing she was fiercely devoted to upholding the rules of the train.<ref name="CC" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': She was able to Transfigure her hands into claws to scare Hogwarts students who tried to leave the train.<ref name="CC" /> [[Human Transfiguration]] is a very difficult branch of Transfiguration, implying she was highly accomplished in this notably complex branch of [[magic]].
*'''[[Charm]]s''': She was able to conjure a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY1"/> a mark of superior magical talent and skill given the immense difficulty of performing such an advanced protective charm.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Trolley_witch_WU.png|thumb|The food trolley lady as seen in {{WU}}]]
*The food trolley lady was portrayed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' by [[Jean Southern]], while in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', she was portrayed by the late [[Margery Mason]]. It may be possible, however, in the film, that the two trolley witches could be two entirely separate individuals.
*In the level "News From Azkaban" in {{LEGO|Y1}}, some students are standing in front of carriage doors on the train, and one must [[Levitation Charm|levitate]] sweets from the trolley to the students' hands, for the doors to open.<ref name="LEGOY1" />
*Because of the Trolley witch's behaviour in ''The Cursed Child'', some have believed her to be some sort of [[magic]]al incarnation or an illusion of the Hogwarts Express itself rather than being an actual living witch. 
*Aged around 161 at the time of her first appearance and 190 in ''The Cursed Child'', she was an unusually old witch.
