'''Cliodna''', also known as '''Cliodne''', was a famous [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[druid]]ess.

==Biography==
An [[Animagus]] with the ability to turn into a sea [[bird]], she was aided by [[Cliodna's birds|three magical birds]] that [[Healing magic|cured]] the sick by singing them to sleep. It was also said that she could turn into a wave. She also discovered the properties of [[Moondew]]. Cliodne appeared on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref>{{PS|G}}</ref><ref>{{COS|G}}</ref><ref>{{POA|G}}</ref>

In September of [[1991]], [[Harry Potter]] picked up a Chocolate Frog Card with a picture of Cliodna, who was scratching her nose.<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Cliodna was highly proficient with potions, as she discovered a new ingredient, [[Moondew]] and its properties in potion-making. Furthermore, she would have needed to have brewed the [[Animagus potion]] in order for her to gain the ability to fully transform, a potion known for being highly difficult, complex and time-consuming, showing her very impressive talent in the art of potion-making. 
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': She was also a mistress of [[transfiguration]], being able to turn herself into a sea [[bird]] at will. Given how [[Human Transfiguration]] is an incredibly complex and even dangerous branch of transfiguration, this was a remarkable [[magic]]al feat.

==Behind the scenes==
*In Irish mythology, [[Wikipedia:Cliodna|Cliodna]] was a goddess of [[love]] and beauty, said to have three brightly coloured birds whose song healed the sick. She left Tir Tairngire to be with her mortal lover, Ciabhán, but drowned as she slept in Glandore harbour in County Cork.
*She was also rumoured to be the "Queen of the [[Banshee]]s".
