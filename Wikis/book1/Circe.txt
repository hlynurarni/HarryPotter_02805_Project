}}'''Circe''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived in ancient [[Greece]], on the island of [[Aeaea]]. She enjoyed [[Cross-Species Transfiguration|transfiguring]] lost sailors into [[Human to pig spell|animals]].<ref name="FWC">[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/card_wizards.html "Famous Wizard Cards"] on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref>

==Biography==
Circe was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]]. [[Harry Potter]] obtained this card from a [[Chocolate Frog]] on his first [[Hogwarts Express|trip]] to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1991]].<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref> There was a portrait of Circe at [[Hogwarts Castle]]. It guarded a secret shortcut between the fourth-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]] and the [[Entrance Hall]] side room. The password required to gain access to said shortcut was ''Piggywiggy''.<ref name="POAG PC">{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Circe was proficient in the [[human to pig spell|human to pig]] [[spell]], as she turned lost sailors into said animals. [[Human transfiguration]] is stated as the most complex one, showing she was highly talented in this very difficult branch of [[magic]].<ref name="FWC"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Circe was a minor goddess in Greek mythology, said to transform sailors lost around her island of [[Aeaea]] into animals via the use of enchanted food. She is perhaps most well known as a figure in Homer's ''Odyssey'', where the hero Odysseus spent a year on her island after freeing his shipmates from her spells.
*Because of her appearance in said Greek texts, Circe is considered by scholars to be the first traditional witch to appear in literature.
