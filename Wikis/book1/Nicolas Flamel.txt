{{Quote|Nicolas Flamel is a historical character. Flamel lived in France in the fourteenth century and is supposed to have discovered how to make a Philosopher's Stone. There are mentions of sightings of him through the centuries because he was supposed to have gained [[immortality]]. There are still streets named after Flamel and his wife Perenelle in Paris.|[[J. K. Rowling]] on Nicolas Flamel}}
'''Nicolas Flamel''' (c. [[1326]]<ref name="birthyear" /> – c. [[1992]]<ref name="death" />) was a [[French]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and famed [[Alchemy|alchemist]] who was the only known maker of the [[Philosopher's Stone]], a legendary substance with incredible powers. He was a close friend and partner with former [[Hogwarts Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He owed his considerable age to the [[Elixir of Life]], which was produced from the Stone, along with his wife [[Perenelle Flamel|Perenelle]]. He was well over six hundred years old as of 1992,<ref name="birthyear" /> being one of the [[List of oldest wizards|oldest wizards]] in history.

Flamel was briefly mentioned on [[Albus Dumbledore (Chocolate Frog Card)|Albus Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life {{c|early 14th century}}===
Nicolas was born in the early [[14th century]]. In his youth, Nicolas attended [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] in the [[Pyrenees]] Mountains of [[France]], and it was there that he met [[Perenelle Flamel|Perenelle]], his future wife. It is said that he later funded both the academy's chateau and grounds, and a [[Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel Fountain|fountain]] on the grounds was named after the couple.<ref name="PM">{{WW|beauxbatons-academy-of-magic}}</ref>

===Gaining immortality {{c|late 14th century-1926}}===
Flamel became a noted alchemist of considerable talent.<ref name="PS13">{{PS|B|13}}</ref> At some point, he created the [[Philosopher's Stone]], an item of immense [[magic]]al power. With the Stone, he created the [[Elixir of Life]], which extended his life. Although it is clear that he used the Elixir to greatly extend his life, it is not specified whether he used the Stone's powers to make himself greatly wealthy, as the Stone is also capable of turning any metal into gold.

Nicolas was implied to have been in personal combat, but had become inactive in this field by the [[1720s]].<ref>In 1927, Nicolas claimed that he had not "seen action" in about 200 years. 200 years before the 1920s is the 1720s, to say it is a rough approximation.</ref> In 1762 he was spotted at an opera house in Paris.

In the [[1890s]], Nicolas first came into contact with the brilliant teenager [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="DH2">{{DH|B|2}}</ref>

===Gellert Grindelwald's revolution {{c|1927-1945}}===
[[File:Jacob and Flamel watching crystal ball.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Flamel and Jacob Kowalski watching future events of the day in the alchemist's crystal ball]]
When Albus Dumbledore began to take action to stop [[Gellert Grindelwald]], Nicolas Flamel, as his friend, decided to help him in this, and agreed to let him use his [[Flamel House|home]] as a safehouse to any potential allies of his should the situation require it. In [[1927]], the [[Magizoologist]] [[Newton Scamander]] decided to take advantage of the invitation and arrived at the Flamel House alongside two [[United States of America|Americans]] by the name [[Porpentina Goldstein]] and [[Jacob Kowalski]], along with [[Yusuf Kama]], a wizard who had tried to take Newt and his friends captive so he was free to track down his intended victim unhindered, only for him to suddenly lose consciousness. Once they had arrived safely at the Flamel House, which by then was well protected by various [[protective enchantment]]s, Mr Scamander was able to remove the [[Water dragon parasite]] from the Kama's eye. While he recovered from the procedure and the parasite's venom, Newt and Tina went to the [[French Ministry of Magic Headquarters|French Ministry of Magic]], so when Nicolas returned home, he found only the inexorable and still unconscious Yusuf and a sleeping Jacob. Kowalski mistook Flamel for a [[ghost]], to which he replied that he was an alchemist and therefore immortal. Kowalski quipped that he did not look more than 375 years old. Jacob accidentally broke Nicolas’s hand shaking it. After the greeting, they both came to the [[Nicolas Flamel's crystal ball|crystal ball]], which showed, among other things, that Grindelwald was about to make rally for his followers at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]] on [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise|Pere Lachaise Cemetery]]. They also saw [[Credence Barebone]] and [[Nagini]] heading there, and [[Queenie Goldstein]], Tina's sister and Jacob fiancee. When Jacob saw the woman, he asked the old man where the place in the ball was located, then quickly ran out of the apartment, first asking Nicolas to look after Kama. However, when Jacob looked at the place where Yusuf should lie, it turned out that it was already empty, making the request obsolete.<ref name="COGS" />

[[File:Flamel talking with Hicks.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Flamel talking with Eulalie Hicks]]
A moment after Jacob left, the vision in the crystal ball changed and presented the upcoming tragic events related to the gathering of Grindelwald's supporters. After seeing that, the alchemist wanted to warn Dumbledore with the help of his [[Nicolas Flamel's phoenix-embossed book|book]], but he couldn't contact him, he eventually contacted [[Eulalie Hicks]], who advised him to go to the rescue himself. Nicolas, however, had doubts, because he had not been in active battle for two hundred years. Then the woman comforted him that everyone still believed in him, which eventually mobilised the old man to help.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

[[File:Flamel fighting with flames.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Flamel fighting the flames conjured by Grindelwald]]
Flamel arrived as Grindelwald had escaped and unleashed [[Protego Diabolica]] in an attempt to destroy Paris, [[Dark Arts|dark magic]] so powerful and unstable that none of the assembled wizards opposed to the [[Dark Wizard]] knew how to counter it. When Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini and [[Theseus Scamander]] ran out of the fire consuming everything, Nicolas ordered them to form a circle, plant their wands in the ground and use the [[General Counter-Spell]]. The effect was the creation of a cleansing, orange fire, which, directed nonverbally, among others by Flamel, eliminated the effect of Grindelwald's spell and saved the whole of city from destruction.<ref name="COGS" />

[[File:Flamel comforting Jacob.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Nicolas comforting Jacob]]
After saving Paris, Nicolas comforted a tearful Jacob Kowalski, whose fiancée Queenie had joined Grindelwald's ranks.<ref name="COGS" />

===Death {{c|1990s}}===
{{Quote|To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure.|Albus Dumbledore about Nicolas Flamel's death.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
By the [[1990s]], Nicolas had moved to [[Great Britain]] with his wife and enjoyed a quiet life in [[Devon]].<ref name="PS13" /> However, the danger of the Stone's existence was brought to light when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], with the help of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Professor]] [[Quirinus Quirrell]], was nearly successful in stealing it for the purpose of restoring Voldemort to physical form. However, his plan was barely thwarted by the efforts of [[Trio|three children]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Flamel agreed, along with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], that the stone should be destroyed. With enough [[Elixir of Life|Elixir]] to set his affairs in order, it was expected that Flamel and his wife would die shortly thereafter. As their deaths drew near, Harry took the news as terrible, but Dumbledore told him that their deaths would be like "going to bed after a very, very long day", implying that when Nicolas and his wife passed on, they accepted their deaths with dignity.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
A kindly old man with a polite disposition, Nicolas Flamel warmly welcomed [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], [[Jacob Kowalski]], [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]], and [[Yusuf Kama]] when they arrived at his home in [[Paris]], treating Dumbledore's "friends" like his own. In spite of his advanced age of over 600, Nicolas was happy to do what he could to help put an end to the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s seemingly unstoppable rise to power, and agreed to let his home be used as a safehouse for those who opposed him. Although he appeared to have had some doubts about his own abilities, Nicolas nevertheless proved himself to be a very brave and selfless individual, as he arrived to help Newt Scamander and the latter's allies to fight Grindelwald at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]] when called upon to do so by [[Eulalie Hicks]] even though he had not been entirely certain that he was up to the task. Although he arrived too late to help fight Grindelwald himself, Nicolas nevertheless displayed great courage both by his timely arrival, and by his help in containing the incredibly powerful, rampant [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] their foe conjured, and was, as such, instrumental to the efforts to save [[Paris]] from it.<ref name="COGS"/>

Despite making efforts to hide his [[Philosopher's Stone]] from the wrong hands (first in [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], then in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]), Nicolas by the age of 690, much like his friend [[Albus Dumbledore]], ultimately viewed death as "but the next great adventure". Hence, after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] very nearly succeeded in capturing his Philosopher's Stone, Nicolas willingly had it destroyed, having collected enough [[Elixir of Life]] to set his and his wife's affairs in order.<ref name="PS17"/>

Flamel was also well known for his love of [[opera]].<ref name="PS13">{{PS|B|13}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.|Flamel accomplished what no other alchemist had|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Alchemycard.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Flamel studying Alchemy]]
Belying his frail exterior, Nicolas Flamel was a very powerful and accomplished wizard. Rich in learning and experience, testaments to Nicolas' considerable abilities were his proficiency in [[alchemy]], held to be some of the most difficult [[magic]] known to [[wizardkind]], and Nicolas helping to save the city of [[Paris]] from the rampant, destructive black fire unleashed by [[Gellert Grindelwald]], the most powerful [[Dark Wizard]] of the early [[20th century]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Alchemy]]''': Nicolas Flamel was perhaps the greatest alchemist the world had ever seen, being the only known person to successfully create a [[Philosopher's Stone]], the ultimate goal of alchemy. With this, Flamel was able to render himself and his wife Perenelle [[Immortality|immortal]] for centuries, until he chose to destroy the stone of his own volition in [[1992]].<ref name="PS13"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Flamel was also an exceptionally gifted [[potioneer]], as by using his alchemical knowledge of the properties of the Philosopher's Stone, he created the [[Elixir of Life]], an incredible potion to make the drinker immortal. The effects of this potion were so extraordinary that by drinking it, he managed to remain alive and well for hundreds of years.<ref name="PS13"/>
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Although the exact extent of his skills is uncertain, it is evident that Nicolas Flamel had extensive knowledge of the [[Dark Arts]] and was extremely adept at defending himself from them, as he instantly recognised and knew how to stop the incredibly dangerous and volatile [[Protego Diabolica|fire]] conjured by [[Gellert Grindelwald]], and, along with [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] and [[Theseus Scamander]], [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]], and [[Yusuf Kama]], successfully contained it by means of a combined powerful [[General Counter-Spell]], thus effectively preventing the destruction of [[Paris]]. Nicolas' home was also described by Dumbledore as being heavily warded by various powerful [[protective enchantment]]s after he turned his home into a safehouse for Dumbledore's friends and allies, showing he was very proficient in the casting of them. Furthermore, Nicolas Flamel claimed that he had not "seen action" in about two hundred years, suggesting that prior to [[1927]], he used to be both an active and highly accomplished [[Duelling|duellist]]. Despite his long absence from using [[martial magic]], however, and initial doubt that he would be of any help in fighting [[Gellert Grindelwald]], [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] professor [[Eulalie Hicks]] had great faith in his defensive abilities, and urged him to go to the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]] to save Newt and his friends, which he did with great success, showing his impressive talents in this field.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Divination]]''': Nicolas Flamel apparently had some ability in Divination, as he could gaze into [[crystal ball]]s and see events unfold elsewhere, such as when he saw [[Credence Barebone]], [[Nagini]], and the upcoming [[Gellert Grindelwald]] rally at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Wandless magic|Wandless]]''' and '''[[Non-verbal magic]]''': Nicolas Flamel proved capable of using both wandless and nonverbal magic, both of which is advanced and highly difficult to perform even individually, yet Nicolas used both simultaneously when he unlocked the padlock on his [[Nicolas Flamel's phoenix-embossed book|phoenix-embossed book]] by simply touching it.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Immortality]]''': Having drunk the Elixir of Life on a continuous basis, Nicolas remained alive for over 600 years.<ref name="PS13"/> However, while this extended his lifespan, his body continued to age, leading to a frail and ancient appearance. His life became completely reliant on the Elixir and the Stone used to brew it. Once he agreed to destroy the Stone and depleted the potion, Nicolas died.<ref name="PS17"/>
*'''Social networking''': Due to having lived over 600 years thanks to the [[Philosopher's Stone]]'s [[Elixir of Life]], Nicolas Flamel has a vast network of international contacts in the whole [[Wizarding world]], communicating with them via his [[Nicolas Flamel's phoenix-embossed book|phoenix-embossed book]]. Notable among his contacts were [[Albus Dumbledore]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and [[Eulalie Hicks]] of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''Bilingualism:''' Nicolas Flamel spoke his native French, as well as fluent English, with only a slight accent in the latter.<ref name="COGS"/>

==Possessions==

*'''[[Nicolas Flamel's wand|Wand]]''': Nicolas owned a [[wand]] of an unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Philosopher's Stone]]''': Nicolas created the legendary and mystical Philosopher's Stone, an incredibly powerful [[magic]]al object that granted him and his wife a greatly extended lifespan through the power of [[Immortality]].<ref name="PS13"/>
*'''[[Elixir of Life]]''': Being the creator of the Philosopher's Stone, Flamel was able to brew the Elixir of Life, a legendary and unique potion that granted the power of immortality to the drinker, which kept him and his wife alive for hundreds of years.<ref name="PS13"/>
*'''[[Flamel House]]''': Flamel owned a house in [[Paris]], that was the home of him and his wife for many years.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Nicolas Flamel's crystal ball|Crystal ball]]''': Nicolas owned a [[crystal ball]] that could be used to [[Divination|see into the future]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Nicolas Flamel's phoenix-embossed book|Phoenix-embossed book]]''': Nicolas owned a book that he used to magically communicate with other [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] throughout the [[Wizarding world]], such as [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] [[professor]] [[Eulalie Hicks]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Nicolas Flamel's Chalice|Chalice]]''': Nicolas owned a chalice that he was believed to have drunk from when practicing alchemy. The [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] student [[Aurélie Dumont]] sought this chalice in the hopes it could make her a great Alchemist and believed it was hidden at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="HM2">{{HM|2|Hosting the Beauxbatons}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Perenelle Flamel===
[[Perenelle Flamel]] was the wife of Nicolas Flamel. Nicolas Flamel shared the [[Philosopher's Stone]] with Perenelle, making them both immortal until the Stone was destroyed in [[1992]].<ref name="PS17"/>

===Albus Dumbledore===
{{Quote|Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the best.|Albus Dumbledore and Flamel's agreement to destroy the stone|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his good and long-time friend]] 
Albus Dumbledore was a close friend to Nicolas. During the [[Global wizarding war]], Flamel let him use his home as a safe house for allies that opposed the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]], and helped protect [[Paris]] from certain destruction at the hands of said revolutionary leader alongside [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], [[Theseus Scamander]], [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] and [[Yusuf Kama]].<ref name="COGS"/> The faith and trust he had in Dumbledore was evident, and highlighted by his allowing Albus to put the Stone in [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in London in [[1991]] to prevent [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] from stealing it. It was also Albus who moved the stone to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for further protection later the same year.<ref name="PS17"/>

==Etymology==
*''Nicolas'' is the French form of the Greek name ''Nikolaos'' meaning "victory of the people".
*The name ''Flamel'' means in Old French "flame". Such meaning can be associated to Flamel's work as an alchemist.

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{PS|FA}}, Flamel's first name is spelt as Nicholas, adding an ''h'' in the subtitles and the book [[Hermione Granger]] reads.
*Also in the film, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] discover the link to Nicolas Flamel and the stone through a book, rather than [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Chocolate Frog Card]]. (In a deleted scene you see them discovering the connection through a chocolate frog card, but it was switched when edited.)
*{{wplink|Nicolas Flamel}} was a real French scribe believed in legend to have been an alchemist who created the Philosopher's Stone. He was born about [[1330]] and died in [[1418]]. There is no proof that the historical Flamel achieved immortality with his wife Perenelle, though a few have claimed to have seen him throughout the centuries, or that he was even involved in alchemy at all. Some treasure-hunters accidentally dug up his grave and discovered that his tomb was empty. Another goal of Nicolas Flamel according to the legend was to turn ordinary lead into pure gold. The reference to Flamel marks one of the few occasions in which a real person has been referenced as a character in the Potter books.
*''Nicolas Flamel'' is the title of chapter 13 in {{PS}}.
*In a deleted first draft of {{PS}}, Harry revealed that Nicolas Flamel was spotted in an [[Parisian opera house|opera house]] which was located in Paris in [[1762]]. Whether this is [[canon]] is unknown.<ref name="early">''"Very early page of Philosopher's Stone"'', by [[J. K. Rowling]] - {{see image|File:Very early page of Philosopher's Stone.jpg}}</ref>
*Nicolas was the first known Beauxbatons student introduced in the series, though the fact that he attended Beauxbatons was only revealed on Pottermore.
*Nicolas Flamel appeared in the [[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald|second film]] of the ''[[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|Fantastic Beasts]]'' [[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|series]], portrayed by [[Brontis Jodorowsky]].<ref>[https://www.pottermore.com/news/next-fantastic-beasts-film-reveals-new-characters-including-nicolas-flamel Pottermore: Nicolas Flamel Cast]</ref>
*The pronunciation of Flamel's first name varies by canon source. While the s is pronounced in the Harry Potter films, Nicolas himself says it with a silent s in {{COG}}, which is the French pronunciation.

===Author's comments===
[[J. K. Rowling]] admitted that several months into the writing of {{PS}}, she had a highly detailed and exceptionally vivid dream about Flamel, which was like "''a renaissance painting come to life''". Flamel was leading her around his cluttered laboratory, which was bathed in golden light, and showing exactly how to make the Stone.<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|nicolas-flamel}}</ref>
