'''Tom''' (fl. [[1938]]—[[1990s]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who was the landlord, innkeeper, and barman of the [[Leaky Cauldron]]. He was very friendly with many [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] that passed through the pub to get to [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="PS5"/> He had run the Leaky Cauldron for a long time, and had had the pleasure of meeting [[Harry Potter]] and former [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] on more than one occasion.<ref name="POA3"/> It is likely he had met other celebrities and political figures in the [[wizarding world]], such as [[Albus Dumbledore]], since his pub leads directly into Diagon Alley. He was very old by the time [[Harry Potter]] knew him, as he was mentioned by Dumbledore in the late 1930s to [[Tom Riddle]].<ref name="HBP13"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tom was likely a pupil at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and studied there from the age of eleven until he left, and eventually became barman/landlord of the [[Leaky Cauldron]] some time before [[1938]]. It is possible that Tom encountered [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]] (later to be known as Lord Voldemort) on his way to [[Diagon Alley]] for the first time, as [[Albus Dumbledore]] had told Tom Riddle to ask for him to get there. Riddle's profound distaste for his given name was, in part, due to it being so common, and meeting the landlord would not have negated this opinion in any way.<ref name="HBP13">{{HBP|B|13}}</ref>

===1990s===
[[File:Tom the Barman.jpg|250px|thumb|Tom in [[1991]]]]
In [[1991]], when [[Harry Potter]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] passed through the Leaky Cauldron on their way to [[Diagon Alley]], Tom greeted Hagrid like an old friend, or, at the very least, a regular. Other witches and wizards who were there at the time (including [[Doris Crockford]], [[Dedalus Diggle]], and [[Quirinus Quirrell]]) began introducing themselves to Harry, before Hagrid managed to get him away from all of them.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

In [[1993]], [[Cornelius Fudge]] (then [[Minister for Magic]]) asked Tom to keep an eye on [[Harry Potter]] while [[Sirius Black]] was on the loose until he was due to return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name="POA3">{{POA|B|3}}</ref>

In [[1996]], the Leaky Cauldron pub was almost completely empty, aside from Tom and Rubeus Hagrid, who greeted Harry Potter when he arrived there. Tom and Harry acknowledged each other, but did not have time to speak, as Harry was busy on Hogwarts business, with Tom gloomily returning to wipe glasses.<ref name="HBP6">{{HBP|B|6}}</ref>

In [[1997]], Tom attended the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]] of [[Albus Dumbledore]] and watched as his body was encased in the [[White Tomb]].<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

In [[1998]], Tom was greeted by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] (who was really [[Hermione Granger]] using [[Polyjuice Potion]]) while on her way to [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] in [[Diagon Alley]], and was surprised by how polite she was towards him.<ref name="DH26">{{DH|B|26}}</ref>

===Post-Second Wizarding War===
Tom passed away or retired during the next 19 years, since [[Hannah Abbott]] eventually took over as landlady and lived at the inn with her husband, [[Neville Longbottom]].<ref name="PM">[[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL]]</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Tom was described by [[Harry Potter]] upon sight as old, "quite bald" and that he resembled a toothless [[Walnut (nut)|walnut]].<ref name="PS5"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal]] and [[Wandless magic]]''': Tom was capable of casting simple wandless and nonverbal spells, such as [[Fire-Making Spell|lighting]] a fireplace,<ref name="POA3">{{POA|B|3}}</ref> as well being able to turn off a car alarm both non-verbally and wandlessly on the [[7 August]], [[1993]].<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref> This implies Tom was a rather powerful and skilled [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in his own right, as casting spells non-verbally and wandlessly is highly difficult and advanced. 
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Tom was capable of producing a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY1"/> a clear mark of superior [[magic]]al ability as well as being able to cast simple charms like the [[Fire-Making Spell]] successfully.<ref name="POA3"/>

==Etymology==
Tom is [[Wikipedia:Diminutive|diminutive]] of the name "Thomas" which means ''infidel'' or unfaithful. It was used as a formal male given name. It also means "twin."

It is also quite likely that [[J. K. Rowling]] intentionally gave him the same first name as Tom Riddle, as the fact was commented on by Albus Dumbledore. While it is unknown if Riddle ever met the Tom who managed the Leaky Cauldron, he was annoyed by being pointed out they had the same forename. Tom Riddle disliked the fact that "Tom" was a common men's name, being those of of [[Tom Riddle Senior|his father]], and [[Thomas Riddle|his grandfather]], and desired to be known more independently.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:TomLEGOHP1-4.png|thumb|Tom as depicted in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*Tom appears in the Game Boy and GBA versions of the video game adaptation of {{COS}}. In the GBA version when Harry and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] missed the train Harry asks him for any [[Floo Powder]] so he and Ron could get to the Burrow and take the car.
*Tom was played by [[Derek Deadman]] in {{PS|FA}}, while he was portrayed by [[Jim Tavaré]] in {{POA|FA}}. There is a difference between the two portrayals: in {{PS|FA}}, he is shown to work as the inn's barman and is straight-backed, but in {{POA|FA}}, he is clearly the innkeeper, as in the books, and appears to be a hunchback. From the in-universe part of it, one can argue that they may simply be separate characters who happen to be namesakes.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, if one plays as Tom, and jumps while standing still, Tom will stumble upon landing and go forward several steps.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, Tom can be unlocked in the first level of Year 1. First, you have to have unlocked the [[Reductor Curse]]. Then, in Gringotts, after you unlock the doors in the mainroom, use Reducto on the chest on the right. The one on the left holds Mr Ollivander.<ref name="LEGOY1"/>
*In {{HBP|FA}}, when the [[Death Eaters]] pass their way from the [[Leaky Cauldron]] to [[Diagon Alley]] to kidnap [[Garrick Ollivander]], it is unknown if Tom or a different associate was at the Leaky Cauldron.
