{{Quote|That was far easier than I thought it would be. I needn't have learned about the [[1637]] [[Werewolf Code of Conduct]] or the [[Uprising of Elfric the Eager|uprising]] of Elfric the Eager.|[[Hermione Granger]], on her [[History of Magic]] [[First year exams|exams]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Elfric the Eager''' was an individual responsible for a [[Uprising of Elfric the Eager|revolt]]. His actions were taught in [[History of Magic]], a course at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Elfric the Eager's species is not established, but since he was responsible for a revolt, and is covered in a [[History of Magic]] class, it is likely he was a [[Goblin]]. However, this has not yet been confirmed.
