{{Quote|I could not be prouder that this simple school text book is now being used in schools for magic all over the world, and has been translated into seventy-two languages, including Gobbledegook and Mermish.|Miranda Goshawk, ''[[Book of Spells]]'' (Foreword)|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}
'''Miranda Goshawk''' (b. [[1921]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and celebrated author who specialised in writing [[Charms (class)|Charms]] spellbooks. The ''[[The Standard Book of Spells|Standard Book of Spells]]'' was a collection written by her and were [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] textbooks, they covered the entire [[Charm]]s syllabus. She also wrote a [[Herbology]] [[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology|encyclopedia]] and the third volume of the ''[[Which Owl?]]'' series.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I was born into a poor family, the last of nine sisters. When I was a youngster, there was no basic spellbook to give a beginner witch like myself the clear and simple instructions that would have made magic a much less mysterious process.|Miranda Goshawk, ''[[Book of Spells]]'' (''Foreword'').|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}Miranda Goshawk was born in [[1921]],<ref name="cfc"/> somewhere in [[Great Britain]], the last of nine daughters born to the wizarding [[Goshawk family]].<ref name="WBoS" /> Her family was relatively impoverished by the time she arrived, and she recalls having to wear her sisters' hand-me-down [[robes]], which she found "embarrassing".<ref name="WBoS" />

In her youth, she received formal instruction, attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from approximately [[1932]] to [[1939]]. Miranda found the complicated instructions and abstruse concepts in her "old-fashioned textbooks" rather hard to understand. To further her confusion when it came to learning magic, her sisters used to deliberately give her the wrong [[incantation]] for every [[spell]] she attempted.<ref name="WBoS"/>

As the youngest child in a large family, she also often found it difficult to make herself heard, and sometimes resorted to using the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] — which she invented herself — to render whoever she wanted to give a piece of her mind silent long enough to let her speak. She used it on her sister [[Diadema Goshawk|Diadema]] to get her to return clothes she borrowed without permission; on her sister [[Romilda Goshawk|Romilda]] to keep her out of her room went she wanted to be left alone; and on her sister [[Tangwystl Goshawk|Tangwystl]] when she wanted to keep her quiet so she could finish her homework.<ref name="WBoS"/>

===Adult life===
After her schooling, in which she self-admittedly "struggled", Ms. Goshawk realised that the help she had needed as a young witch simply did not exist. In response to this, she made a living by writing school textbooks all the while striving to make her writings both scientifically correct and academically useful, but also appealing and plain enough to be understood without too much difficulty, allowing every student to be in possession of knowledge about "''basic and not-so-basic''" witchcraft.<ref name="WBoS"/>

Her first book, the ''[[Book of Spells]]'', was a success: it was not only translated into seventy-two languages (among them, [[Gobbledegook]] and [[Mermish]]), but it also became an approved textbook in many schools for magic around the world. Goshawk did not miss the opportunity to get back at her sisters for their mischievous pranks: she had "special editions" of ''[[Book of Spells]]'' (actually just editions with several misprints) sent to them. As a result, and as part of a series of "comical mishaps", her sister [[Romilda Goshawk|Romilda]] was left with a tail, and Miranda's relationship with her sisters was negatively affected. Goshawk notes that the tail eventually vanished, and that the sisters became friends again.<ref name="WBoS"/>

Goshawk's decision to include [[jinx]]es in the school textbook ''[[Book of Spells]]'' was controversial. She later defended it by stating that she believed including mild offensive spells in the book would deter students from seeking out more dangerous spells with which to settle their disputes.<ref name="WBoS" />

It was around this time, presumably, that Ms. Goshawk penned the ''[[The Standard Book of Spells]]'' series, a collection of [[Charms (class)|Charms]] textbooks that have been regularly requested at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref> by [[Charms Master]] [[Filius Flitwick]], regarded as "''the best and most knowledgeable Charms master alive in the world today''",<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM}}</ref> further attesting to the prestige of Goshawk's works. Ms. Goshawk has also published a comprehensive [[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology|encyclopedia of Herbology]]<ref name="GFf">{{GOF|F}}</ref> and has written the third volume of the ''[[Which Owl?]]'' collection.<ref name="CSf">{{COS|F}}</ref>

In recognition of her efforts in the teaching of magic, Miranda Goshawk was immortalised in a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] bearing her effigy and achievements.

==Personality and traits==
Goshawk was a highly intelligent witch with an immense and wide-ranging knowledge of [[magic]] and [[spell]]s. She was a highly committed and hard-working individual, who dedicated her career to writing academic textbooks which would be understood by wizards and witches everywhere. This showed she believed the promotion of education to [[Wizardkind]] to be of the utmost importance to herself. She was also highly creative, and even invented the Bat-Bogey Hex in her youth, showing her to possess superior [[magic]]al knowledge and ability.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s mastery''': Goshawk was shown to be highly masterful in charm-work, having authored the [[The Standard Book of Spells]] series, which contained information on how to perform a very wide variety of different charms and [[spell]]s. Her books were often used in Charms classes at Hogwarts, showing her books to having been highly useful and informative, showing her excellent prowess in this subject. Her abilities in Charms were further shown by the complex and powerful enchantments she placed on her original [[Book of Spells]], where it could project the speeches she had made to greet those who read the book and create safe spaces or dangerous places for practising spells.
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Goshawk was very knowledgeable of Herbology and herself a [[Herbologist]], the study of [[magic]]al and mundane plants and fungi, having written an expansive encyclopedia on the subject, titled ''[[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology]]''.
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Although not a well-known talent of hers, Goshawk was evidently quite apt in handling magical [[creature]]s, as she was at least good enough in handling [[owl]]s to author the third book in the ''[[Which Owl?]]'' series.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Her books covered descriptions and instructions how to cast [[nonverbal spell]]s, meaning she would have been proficient in the casting of such spells. This implies she was in fact a powerful witch, given the high level difficulty required in casting spells non-verbally.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Goshawk was talented in this highly complex and [[Science|scientific]] branch of [[magic]], as she could turn [[Human to toad spell|people into toads]]. Given the difficulty of [[Human Transfiguration]], this shows she was highly proficient in this field.
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Goshawk in her youth invented the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] herself. Given how the art of spell creation is incredibly complicated and dangerous, this proves she possessed superior magical abilities and a highly inventive and imaginative mind, particularly at having created the potent [[hex]] at such a young age.
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Goshawk evidently had quite an impressive amount of talent in dark magic, as she successfully created the [[Bat-Bogey Hex|Bat Bogey Hex]], a [[hex]] which turns the snot in an individual's nostrils into flying vicious [[bat]]s to attack them. Though many of her books in her ''[[The Standard Book of Spells]]'' advised young witches and wizards against casting [[dark charm]]s and thus did not instruct them, showing she was also carefully aware of the dangers of engaging in such unpleasant and sinister magics, in her original Book of Spells, she included the instructions on how to cast the [[Knockback Jinx]], the [[Impediment Jinx]], and [[Reductor Curse]], showing her knowledge of dark magic was nevertheless sufficient enough to allow her to effectively guide on how to use them, and along with that, she was also good enough with the [[Oppugno Jinx]] to enhance the book to use it manually.

==Etymology==
*Miranda is from Spanish and means "admirable" or "beautiful." A goshawk is a large, powerful species of hawk with rounded wings, long tail and brown or grey feathers. It is also pronounced like "''Got chalk''" nodding towards her teaching standard.

==Behind the scenes==
*Miranda Goshawk was voiced by [[Rachel Atkins]] in the English edition of {{WBS}}.
*''[[Book of Spells]]'' was purportedly "200 years old",<ref name="rowlingofficial">[http://www.jkrowling.com/en_US/timeline/wonderbook-book-of-spells Rowling Announcement About ''Wonderbook: Book of Spells'']</ref> suggesting it was published sometime in [[1812]] (200 years prior to 2012, the year in which the game was released) or [[1791]]-[[1798]] (200 years before the time setting of the [[Harry Potter series|''Harry Potter'' novels]]. Possible explanations include that the game is set sometime after [[After 2021|After 2121]] or that the Chocolate Frog Card gave an incorrect birth date, or that the developers simply do not care about these things nearly as much as the fans.
