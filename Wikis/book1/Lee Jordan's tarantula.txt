{{Quote|Listen, we're going down to the middle of the train â€” Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there.|Fred or George Weasley|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[Lee Jordan]] brought this '''tarantula''' to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in his [[third year]] there. He kept this [[spider]] in a box while boarding the [[Hogwarts Express]] in [[1991]]. Lee Jordan showed it to his best friends [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] on the train.<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

[[Lee Jordan]] lost his pet tarantula at [[Hogwarts Castle]] on the [[1992-1993 school year]] and put up a notice at the [[Gryffindor Notice Board|Gryffindor pasteboard]]. [[Harry Potter]] subsequently retrieved it, as he found it wandering around the [[Hogwarts Library|library]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*By bringing a tarantula, Lee broke the school rule that only allowed students to keep [[cat]]s, [[owl]]s and [[toad]]s. However, this could be more of a guideline than a hard-and-fast rule, as other students have been shown bringing various other small creatures, such as the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] rat called [[Peter Pettigrew#Scabbers|Scabbers]] or [[Ginny Wealsy|Ginny's]] [[Pygmy Puff]] called [[Arnold]].
