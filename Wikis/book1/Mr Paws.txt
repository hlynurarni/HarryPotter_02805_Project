'''Mr Paws''' was one of [[Arabella Figg|Mrs Figg's]] part-[[Kneazle]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221040/https://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 Extra Stuff: Squibs] from {{JKRS}} (via the Internet Archive)</ref> The other three were [[Mr Tibbles]], [[Snowy]] and [[Tufty]]. [[Harry Potter]] saw it (or possibly its picture) when he went to stay with Mrs Figg when [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] got to go to places on his birthday. Harry found a hard time being remorseful when Mrs Figg broke her leg after reminding himself that it would be a while before he had to see Mr Tibbles, Snowy, Tufty and Mr Paws again.<ref>{{PS|B|2}}</ref>
