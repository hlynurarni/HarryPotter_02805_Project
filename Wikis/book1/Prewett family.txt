'''Prewett''' was the surname of a [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizarding]] family, and one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]]. They were related to the [[House of Black|Black]], [[Weasley family|Weasley]], and [[Macmillan family|Macmillan]] families.<ref name="BFT">''[[House of Black|Black family tree]]''</ref> With the deaths of [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]] in the [[First Wizarding War]],<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref> the status of the Prewett family is unknown,<ref name="status"/> though it continued in the female line through the children of [[Molly Weasley]].

==Family history==
Some members of the Prewett family would likely have been labelled "[[blood traitor]]s", as they were members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and did not believe in the ideology of [[Blood status|blood purity]]. However, the attitude of the prejudiced [[House of Black]] towards the Prewetts suggests that not all members were considered blood traitors. [[Lucretia Black]] was not disowned for marrying [[Ignatius Prewett]],<ref name="BFT">''[[House of Black|Black family tree]]''</ref> implying that the Prewetts were more accepted in elite pure-blood circles than a family like the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]].

Distinctive family traits included red hair<ref>{{HPLE|G}} {{see image|File:MollyWeasleyMinistryFile.png}}</ref> and large noses.<ref>[http://e-card.51.net/movie.scripts/Harry.Potter/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.htm ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' - Full Tan Draft]</ref>

It is unknown whether Molly's second cousin (a squib accountant) was a pure-blood or not; he could have had a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] mother.

|Brother of Mr Prewett and uncle of Molly, Gideon, and Fabian<ref>[[Sirius Black]] stated in Ch. 6 of ''Order of the Phoenix'' that Molly Weasley was his "cousin by marriage". This means that Ignatius could not have been Molly, Fabian, and Gideon's father, as this would have made them first cousins by blood of Sirius. Ignatius was Sirius's uncle by marriage, and if Molly was his niece, this could explain Sirius's comment. See this [[Talk:Ignatius Prewett|talk page]] for more information.</ref>

|Uncle of the [[Weasley family|Weasley children]] who attended [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s wedding in [[1997]], he may be a brother of [[Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley née Prewett]] or one of her [[Arthur Weasley's brothers|brothers-in-law]].

|[[Muriel's mother]]

|-
|[[Muriel]]
|A great-aunt of [[Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley née Prewett]], thus an aunt or aunt-in-law to [[Molly Weasley's father|Mr]] or [[Molly Weasley's mother|Mrs Prewett]]. While Muriel is Molly's great-aunt, and thus related to the family, it is not confirmed as to whether she is a Prewett.<ref>[https://www.pottermore.com/features/aunt-muriel-vs-aunt-marge Pottermore -] states that Muriel is "technically Mrs Weasley's great aunt"</ref>
|-
|[[Tessie]]
|A great-aunt of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and his siblings.<ref>{{GOF|F}}</ref> She might be an aunt of Molly's or of Arthur's. If the former is the case, then Tessie is related to the family, although it would not be certain that she was a Prewett.

==Etymology==
The surname ''Prewett'' is Welsh in origin. It is derived from the Middle English word ''prou'', meaning "brave" or "valiant", and the suffix "-et", which implies smallness. Thus, it is believed to be derived from a nickname for someone small, but brave.<ref>[http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.fc/qx/prewett-family-crest.htm House of Names: Prewett]</ref>
