==Biography==

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Morgana's famous Wizard Card described her as a powerful [[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]],<ref name="fwc" /> meaning she would have highly proficient in many areas of dark magic and with the casting of [[dark charm]]s.  
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Morgana was revealed to have mastered the art of [[Human Transfiguration]], having become an [[Animagus]]; being able to turn herself into a [[bird]] at will,<ref name="wotc" /> showing remarkable proficiency in this highly difficult branch of [[magic]].  
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Being an Animagus, Morgan would have needed to have successfully brewed an [[Animagus potion]], in order to gain the ability to transform. This implies that she had great skill in potions, as brewing the Animagus potion is immensely difficult, complex and time-consuming.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Morgan Le Fay-17-chocFrogCard.png|thumb|Morgan le Fay on a Famous Wizard Card]]
*In the 1998 television film ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(miniseries) Merlin]'', with {{Wplink|Sam Neill}} as the title character, Morgan le Fay was portrayed by [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who later went on to play Dark witch and [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].
*Before [[Emma Watson]] got the part of [[Hermione Granger]], she had acted only in school plays; one was "Arthur's Early Years", in which she played the role of Morgan le Fay.
*Morgan le Fay is based on the legendary figure [[Wikipedia:Morgan le Fay|of the same name]], the daughter of King Arthur's mother the Lady Igraine and her first husband Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall (making her Arthur's half-sister in legend too).
*Morgan le Fay's time of existence in the Harry Potter Universe (like Merlin, King Arthur etc) is paradoxical as the Morgan le Fay of the Arthurian legends is said to have lived in the 5th or 6th century. As Merlin attended Hogwarts and she was an enemy of Merlin, then she, like the ''legendary ''version of Merlin predates Hogwarts by around 400/500 years.
