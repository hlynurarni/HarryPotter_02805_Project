'''Hallowe'en''', a contraction of '''"All Hallows' Evening"''', is a holiday celebrated by both [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and the [[wizarding world|Wizarding World]] on [[31 October]]. Typical festive Hallowe'en activities include; trick-or-treating, attending costume parties, decorating, carving [[pumpkin]]s into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, [[Apple (fruit)|apple]] bobbing, visiting haunted attractions, playing pranks, and telling scary stories.<ref name="wiki">{{Wikilink|Hallowe'en}}</ref> This applies to the [[wizarding world]] also, but with their own [[magic]]al twist.<ref name="PS10"/>

==Recent events==

==Hallowe'en feast==
{{main|Hallowe'en feast}}The Hallowe'en Feast at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry occurs on the 31st of October every year. The Hallowe'en Feast is usually festooned with sweets-filled [[pumpkin]]s, [[bat]]s, orange streamers, [[water]] [[snake]]s, goblets of coloured sweets and all sorts of Hallowe'en-related decorations. There is usually some entertainment at the end, which may be by the Hogwarts ghosts, who pop out of the walls and do formation gliding.<ref name="PS10"/>

It is a highly anticipated feast which most Hogwarts students look forward to every year.<ref name="PS10"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Hallowe'en is a very important date in the ''Harry Potter'' books. Either during or after the feast in the first four books something fateful happens. The troll, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] re-opening, [[Sirius Black]]'s attack on the [[Fat Lady]], and [[Harry Potter]]'s name emerging from the [[Goblet of Fire]]. In the seventh book, we discover that the date, 31 October is significant, as it is the date of James and Lily Potter's death in 1981.
*Hallowe'en can be also called "All Hallows' Eve" (meaning "All Saints' Eve", as 1 November is All Saints' Day), which shares part of its name with the [[Deathly Hallows]]. All Hallows' Eve was the date Harry first cheated death and defeated Voldemort, while the Deathly Hallows helped him cheat death and defeat Voldemort again with the [[Elder Wand]].
*In {{HM}}, certain places at Hogwarts, including the [[common room]]s and the [[Great Hall]], decorated with Hallowe'en decorations in October and early November in real time. The player can help [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] with Hallowe'en decorations during this time to earn [[house points]].
