'''Lily Moon''' (c. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a witch who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. She was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was Sorted into either [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], or [[Slytherin]].<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref><ref name=house />

==Behind the scenes==
*Only Lily's surname was revealed during the [[Sorting ceremony]] in {{PS}}, but on the student list shown on {{HPM}}, the first three letters of her first name could be made out as either "Lil-" or "Lib-". Her full first name was finally revealed by [[J. K. Rowling]] as supplementary content on the {{PM}} website.<ref name="pottermore">{{PM}} (transcription available [http://lady-slytherin-forever.tumblr.com/post/8979923935/the-original-forty-off-pottermore here])</ref> According to Rowling, this character was named before she settled on the name of [[Harry Potter]]'s [[Lily J. Potter|mother]], and was the "first intimation of [[Luna Lovegood]]," giving her the idea for a "fey, dreamy girl."<ref name="pottermore" />
*During a practical examination, for their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]], Lily was not called to take her test. She would usually appear after [[Draco Malfoy]] but before [[Theodore Nott]]. This could just be a mistake of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s, or Lily may have been unable to attend her test. It is possible that she had failed her exams at a point between first and fourth year, forcing her to repeat the year.
