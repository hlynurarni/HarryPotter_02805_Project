'''Perenelle Flamel''' (pre [[1334]] – between [[1992]] and [[1996]])<ref name="death"/> was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the wife of famous Philosopher and [[Alchemy|Alchemist]], [[Nicolas Flamel]], who was known for his creation of the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

==Biography==
She and her husband met at [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] in their youth.<ref name="PM">{{WW|beauxbatons-academy-of-magic}}</ref> Perenelle and her husband drank the [[Elixir of Life]] produced by the stone, and were [[immortality|immortal]], until the stone was destroyed in [[1992]], after which she and Nicolas would later die. She was at least six hundred and eighty three years old at the time of her death.<ref name="birthdate" />

She may have had a friendship with [[Albus Dumbledore]] like her husband. Having lived for so long, both Perenelle and her husband were glad to finally embrace death, which to them was like "going to bed after a very long day".<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Nicolas Flamel===
Perenelle Flamel was the wife of [[Nicolas Flamel]]. She, along with her husband, drank the [[Elixir of Life]] created by the [[Philosopher's Stone]] making her [[Immortality|immortal]]. [[Nicolas Flamel|Nicolas]] and Perenelle lived over 600 years happily together.<ref name="PS13">{{PS|B|13}}</ref> After the [[Philosopher's Stone]] was nearly stolen by Lord Voldemort, the couple agreed that it should be destroyed. Despite their immortality, they were not afraid of dying and they both died thereafter.<ref name="PS17"/>

==Etymology==
''Perenelle'' is the Old French form on the name ''Petronilla'', a diminutive of the name ''Petronia'', which is the feminine form of ''Petronius'' - a Roman family name which is possibly derived from Latin petro, petronis "yokel".

Petro-, of both Latin and Greek origin, is a prefix meaning "of or pertaining to stone."

The name ''Flamel'' means in Old French "flame". Such meaning can be associated to Flamel's work as an alchemist.
