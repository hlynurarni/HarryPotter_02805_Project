'''Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions''', also known as '''Madam Malkin's Robes'''<ref name="LEGO">{{LEGO|Y1}}</ref> or simply '''Madam Malkin's''', is a shop in [[Diagon Alley North Side|North Side]], [[Diagon Alley]]. Students get their [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] school uniforms there, and [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] can also purchase dress robes, travelling cloaks, and also, on very rare occasions, [[invisibility cloak]]s.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

==History==
===1991===
[[Harry Potter]] first visited the shop in [[1991]] after [[Rubeus Hagrid]] told him to get his uniform robes for [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. Hagrid was incapable of entering the shop due to his size so after recovering from [[Motion sickness|sickness]] in the [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] [[Mine Cart]]s, he bought two large [[ice cream]]s for each of them. During his visit to the shop, Harry met [[Draco Malfoy]] for the first time.<ref name="PS5"/>

===[[1992]]===
During the [[Christmas holidays]], Madam Malkin's was closed with a small notice on the door, which read <!-- DO NOT change the spelling. The typo is an intentional pun. -->"''We are closed due to daylight robery - back at seven o'cloak''" (An obvious pun on "robbery" and "clock).<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}} {{C|PS1 version}}</ref>

===[[1993]]===
Due to growing several more inches, Harry returned to Madam Malkin's to buy new uniform robes.<ref name="POA4">{{POA|B|4}}</ref>

===[[1995]]===
[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], Harry, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] were reading the [[Daily Prophet]], where it was mentioned that they were having a sale.<ref name="OOTP14">{{OOTP|B|14}},</ref>

===1996===
In [[1996]], Harry and Malfoy met again in the shop, openly insulted each other and almost started a fight. Madam Malkin was shocked when Draco openly called Hermione a [[Mudblood]]. Moments later, Draco refused to let Madam Malkin lift up the sleeve of his dress robes to hem it. Harry suspected this was because Draco had recently become a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and had been branded with the [[Dark Mark]]. Draco and his mother then left the shop, the latter commenting disdainfully that she would not return now that she knew the shop served "scum", and went to shop at [[Twilfitt and Tattings]], leaving Madam Malkin highly insulted.<ref name="HBP6">{{HBP|B|6}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' the trio encountering the Malfoys in Madam Malkin's is omitted, but the shop can be seen briefly in the background when the [[Death Eaters]] and [[Fenrir Greyback]] raid [[Ollivanders]] and kidnap [[Garrick Ollivander]].
