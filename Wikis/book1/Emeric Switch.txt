==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Switch was an expert on this highly advanced, complicated and [[Science|scientific]] branch of [[magic]], having authored the [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] textbook ''[[A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration]]'', as well as having contributed to the academic journal ''[[Transfiguration Today]]'' about [[Human Transfiguration]], showing his proficiency and skill in this field. 

==Etymology==
''Emeric ''is a variant of ''Emmerich'', which means "whole, universal". This could relate to him being able to do transfiguration, as he can wholly turn something into something universally else.

To switch is to exchange one thing with another; could be extended to transfiguration, changing one form into another.

==Behind the scenes==
*Emeric Switch's portrait, as featured in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], seems to have been based on a [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Robert_Southey_by_Vandyke.jpg c. 1795 portrait] of English poet [[Wikipedia:Robert Southey|Robert Southey]], by Pieter van Dyke.
