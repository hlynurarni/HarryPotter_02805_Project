'''Flourish and Blotts Bookseller''' is a bookshop in [[Diagon Alley North Side|North Side]], [[Diagon Alley]], about halfway down the street on the left hand side.<ref name="twitter">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/630391064881459200 Flourish and Blotts.

The shop is filled with shelves stacked to the ceiling.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

The shop has had a few problems with certain books, such as ''[[The Invisible Book of Invisibility]]'' which cost them a great deal of [[Wizarding currency|money]] though they never found them, and ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'' which tore each other up as well as biting the [[Manager of Flourish and Blotts|manager]] when he tried to get one out.<ref name="PA4">{{POA|B|4}}</ref>

The shop holds occasional book-signings, such as when [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] stopped by in [[1992]] to sign copies of his latest book [[Magical Me]].<ref name="CS4"/> Flourish and Blotts also runs a service, which enables purchasers to buy books via [[owl]] delivery.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref> They also take advance orders for books that are in high demand, such as ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]''.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

==History==
===Establishment===
Flourish and Blotts was first established in [[Diagon Alley]] in the year of [[1654]].<ref name="LHP5-7"/>
===1927===

On [[19 March]] [[1927]], Flourish and Blotts and [[Obscurus Books]] held a book launch for [[Newton Scamander]]'s {{FB}}.<ref name="COG">{{COG}}</ref>

===1980s===
In [[1988]], [[Jacob's sibling]] and either [[Merula Snyde]], [[William Weasley]] or [[Jae Kim]] came to the shop to ask [[Villanelle|Madam Villanelle]] about [[Mundungus Fletcher]].<ref name="HM510">{{HM|5|10}}</ref>

===1990s===
{{Quote|Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know-Who’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?|1997 Hogwarts school shopping|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}Flourish and Blotts was briefly closed during the summer of [[1991]], as they were dealing with an outbreak of [[bookworm]]s.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}} - GBC version</ref>

[[File:Harr Potter takes image with Lockhart.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lockhart and Harry Potter during the book signing at Flourish and Blotts]]

In [[1991]], [[Harry Potter]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] visited Flourish and Blotts whilst shopping in Diagon Alley, in order to purchase all of Harry's assigned [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] textbooks. Harry also was interested at a copy of ''[[Curses and Counter-Curses]]'', however Hagrid made him put the book down after telling him he was too young to begin casting [[curse]]s.<ref name="PS5"/>

Sometime in early [[1992]], Flourish and Blotts was closed as it attempted to locate its order of [[Disappearing Ink]]. In August of [[1992]], famous [[Wizardkind|wizard]] author [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] held a book signing at the shop and used it as an opportunity to announce his taking of the post of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] that year. In an effort to gain more publicity, he dragged [[Harry Potter]] into the spotlight against his will and gifted Harry a complete set of his books. That same day, a fistfight occurred between [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Arthur Weasley]], and Lucius Malfoy secretly gave [[Tom Riddle]]'s [[Tom Riddle's Diary|Diary]] to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]].<ref name="CS4">{{COS|B|4}}</ref>

During the [[Christmas holidays]], the bookshop was temporarily closed, as they were still tidying up after [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s book signing in August.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

[[File:Monster_book.png|250px|thumb|The inside of Flourish and Blotts, during [[1993]]]]

In late summer of [[1993]], the front window of Flourish and Blotts held an iron cage filled with hundreds of copies of ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]''. To deal with the vicious books set for the third year [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class taught by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the harassed manager had to gear up with thick gloves and jab at them with a knobbly walking stick, as the books tend to viciously rip and tear each other apart.<ref name="PA4"/>

When [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] went to the shop to buy their schoolbooks, the manager almost cried when Ron and Hermione said they wanted two copies of ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'', but was very relieved when Harry noted that he already had a copy. Harry also asks for a copy of [[Unfogging the Future]] to which the manager leads them to a small corner in the back of the shop where a small table lies for books on Fortune Telling, such as: [[Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks]], [[Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the Worst is Coming]], and [[Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul]].<ref name="PA4" />

In the summer of [[1994]], [[Molly Weasley]] went to Florish and Blotts to get three copies of [[The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4]] for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<ref name="GOF10">{{GOF|B|10}}</ref> As Harry and Ron thought they did not make the cut to proceed to [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level for [[Potions (class)|Potions]], they did not buy the necessary [[Advanced Potion-Making|textbook]].<ref name="HBP9">{{HBP|B|9}}</ref> However, with the [[Horace Slughorn|new teacher]] lowering the entrance standards, Harry and Ron took the subject and wrote to Flourish and Blotts to get a copy of the book delivered to them.<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>

==Layout==
Flourish and Blotts is filled to the brim with books. Shelves upon shelves line the walls, from ceiling to floor. The books are of all sizes and different varieties.<ref name="PS5"/> There is in fact so many books that various signs are posted throughout the shop, as a means of helping customers find what they need. The front windows usually contain displays of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs.<ref name="PA4"/>

==Staff==
In addition to the store's manager, who at times helps customers himself,<ref name="PA4" /> the store also employs an assistant manager (paid 42 [[Galleon]]s a month)<ref name="dp">''[[Daily Prophet]]''</ref> and an assistant.<ref name="CS4"/> The job is not altogether easy, as wizarding books might attempt to bite or simply be completely invisible,<ref name="PA4" /> and fights — like the scuffle between [[Arthur Weasley]] and [[Lucius Malfoy]] in 1992, that sent books raining down on everyone's heads<ref name="CS4"/> — are apparently commonplace enough that a classified posting for a new assistant manager requires that he or she be "''good at breaking up fights''".<ref name="dp"/>

*The set for Flourish and Blotts was a redress of the set for [[Garrick Ollivander]]'s [[Ollivanders|shop]], which reflects on the real-world as shops on [[Diagon Alley]] would most likely have similar layouts due to space requirements, as a row of mini-mall shops might.
*The 2-disc DVD edition of {{COS|FA}} includes an interactive tour of Diagon Alley and this shop, which is the only shop interior in the tour to also be interactive.
*Books in {{PM}} can be bought here.
