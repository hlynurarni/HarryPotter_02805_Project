The '''Chudley Cannons''' are an [[England|English]] [[Quidditch team]] from [[Chudley]] that played in the [[British and Irish Quidditch League]] and, in [[1972]], participated in the [[International Quidditch Tournament]]. They wear [[Chudley Cannons Jersey|bright orange robes]], and their logo includes two black Cs and a speeding cannonball. They have won the [[League Cup]] twenty-one times, the last time in [[1892]]; many consider their glory days to be over. There is a [[Chudley Cannons Fan Club]].

==Motto==
[[File:Chudley Cannons shirt - QTA-IE.jpg‎‎|thumb|250px|The team's motto]]
The club motto was "''We shall conquer''" until [[1972]], the same year that they played in the [[International Quidditch Tournament]], when it was changed to "''Let's all just keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best''".

==History==
===[[1892]]===
The Chudley Cannons won the League for the last time.

===[[20th century]]===

[[File:Chudley Cannons Banner.png|250px|thumb|A Chudley Cannons banner]]

In [[1931]], the Cannons won the ''[[Josef Wronski Award for Excellent Pitch Skills]]''.

In [[1972]], the team played in the [[International Quidditch Tournament]] and changed their official motto.

In around [[1987]], the Chudley Cannons lost a game.<ref>{{HM|3|Bill's Secret}} - When interacting with a pile of books "It says the Chudley Cannons lost yesterday."</ref>

In [[August]] 1992, the Cannons were ninth in the League.<ref>{{COS|B|3}}</ref>

In [[1998]], the [[Appleby Arrows]] defeated the Chudley Cannons in the summer, aided by a pathetic performance by Cannon's [[Seeker]] [[Galvin Gudgeon]]. The Cannons were at the bottom of the table on [[31 July]].<ref name="DP"/>

In [[1999]], the Chudley Cannons broke a sixteen-game losing streak by drawing with the [[Caerphilly Catapults]]. On [[8 February]] they languished bottom of the League with 230 points. The Cannons narrowly defeated [[Wigtown Wanderers]] in [[Bodmin Moor]]. On 1 June the [[Falmouth Falcons]] were the team at the bottom of the League. The Cannons then defeated the Falcons in [[Exmoor]], keeping the Falcons in bottom place. The shock of the victory caused the Cannons' manager [[Ragmar Dorkins]] to collapse. On [[1 October]], the Chudley Cannons were in eleventh place in the League.<ref name="DP"/>

===[[21st century]]===
An unidentified female Chudley Cannons player appeared as one of the [[Foundable]]s during the [[Calamity]], which affected the [[Wizarding World]] in the [[2010s]]. She was trapped by a shackle [[Confoundable]] and had to be freed by a volunteer member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] with the use of the [[Unlocking Charm]].<ref>{{WU}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==

[[File:QuidditchPlayerChudleyCannonsWU.png|200px|thumb|Player Chudley Cannons as he appears in {{WU}}]]
*They are [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s favourite team. The bedspread, walls, and ceiling of [[Ronald Weasley's bedroom|his room]] at [[the Burrow]] were all decorated in a "violent shade of orange", and posters of the team's players covered nearly every inch of the walls, and he owned a team badge. In 1997, [[Harry Potter]] used magic on his poster, making it temporarily turn blue.
[[File:Chudley_Cannons_logo.jpg|150px|thumb|Chudley Cannons' logo]]
*[[J. K. Rowling]], when asked if the Chudley Cannons would ever win a game, replied that "they'd need to replace the entire team and down several cauldrons of [[Felix Felicis]]."
*In the [[8 February]] 1999 edition of the [[Daily Prophet]], 'Chudley Cannon memorabilia - fan making "clean break"', is an advertisement in the 'For Sale' section.<ref name="DP"/>
*They have a certain resemblance to three American Major League Baseball teams, which likewise have notoriously strong fanbases in spite of a near-legendary reputation for not having won the championship for nearly, or more than, a century:
**The [[wikipedia:Chicago White Sox|Chicago White Sox]], who won their first two World Series titles in [[1906]] and [[1917]], and returned to the World Series again in [[1919]]. During the 1919 series, however, a match fixing incident known as the [[wikipedia:Black Sox Scandal|Black Sox Scandal]] occurred, in which eight members of the team were accused of intentionally losing the series in exchange for money. Despite returning to the World Series again in [[1959]], the White Sox would not go on to win until the [[wikipedia:2005 World Series|2005 World Series]], in which they defeated the Houston Astros after a World Series championship drought of 88 years, the longest championship "drought" break in the history of baseball until the Chicago Cubs in the 2016 World Series;
**The [[wikipedia:Chicago Cubs|Chicago Cubs]], who became the first Major League team to play in three consecutive World Series championships (in [[1906]], [[1907]] and [[1908]]), as well as the first team to win two consecutive championships (in 1907 and 1908), but subsequently set two records for droughts in sports, failing to win a National League pennant between [[1945]] and [[2016]] (a 71-year drought) or a World Series championship between 1908 and 2016 (a 108-year drought);
**The [[wikipedia:Boston Red Sox|Boston Red Sox]], who won the first-ever World Series title (in [[1903]]), and won four more titles, the last being in [[1918]] before an 86-year drought that ended with their victory in [[2004]].
**The droughts suffered by the Chicago Cubs and the Boston Red Sox both gave rise to superstitions that the teams had been [[curse]]d:
***The Chicago Cubs' 71-year drought between 1945 and 2016 was attributed to the [[Wikipedia:Curse of the Billy Goat|Curse of the Billy Goat]];
***The Red Sox' drought was attributed to the "[[Wikipedia:Curse of the Bambino|Curse of the Bambino]]", supposedly placed on them by their star player, [[Wikipedia:Babe Ruth|Babe Ruth]], after being traded to their greatest rivals, the [[Wikipedia:New York Yankees|New York Yankees]].
*The Chudley Cannons crest featured in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|film series]] includes the inscription "Est. [[1753]]".<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} {{see image|File:ChudleyCannons.png}}</ref> This, however, cannot be taken as [[canon]] since it goes against information in {{QTA}}, in which it is specified that the Chudley Cannons were one of the thirteen Quidditch teams selected to join the [[British and Irish Quidditch League]] when it was first established in [[1674]].<ref>{{QTA|R|7}}</ref>
*The team's logo, featuring two crossed artillery pieces, bears some resemblance to that of the real-life British football club [[Wikipedia:Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].
*The team's logo includes three interlaced crescent moons. This is considered a Celtic or Pagan symbol, sometimes representing the Three Fates.
**It is also the emblem of Diane de Poitiers, a French noblewoman who had several connections to the moon including her name, manner of dress, and the crest itself.

*In a [https://twitter.com/jonkerlin/status/1027304342985105408 tweet] on August 8th, 2018, [https://twitter.com/jonkerlin Jonathan Carlin], half of the popular fandom theorising YouTube duo, [https://www.youtube.com/SuperCarlinBrothers Super Carlin Brothers] uploaded a video of lyrics appearing onscreen, accompanied by the chanting of a comedic, unofficial Chudley Cannons theme song, in reference to the video uploaded the previous day to the Super Carlin Brothers YouTube channel.
