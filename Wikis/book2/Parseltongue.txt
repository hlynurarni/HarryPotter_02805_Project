{{Quote|[[Hannah Abbott|Hannah]], he’s a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that’s the mark of a [[Dark Wizard]]. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.| Parseltongue's infamous reputation|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

'''Parseltongue''' is the language of [[snake|serpents]] (as well as other magical serpentine creatures, like the [[Runespoor]] and [[Basilisk]]) and those who can converse with them. An individual who can speak Parseltongue is known as a '''Parselmouth'''. It is a very uncommon skill, and was known to be an almost exclusively hereditary trait.<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref> Not counting [[Herpo the Foul]], who predated him by several centuries,<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref> nearly all known Parselmouths are descended from [[Salazar Slytherin]], with [[Harry Potter]] being a notable exception (although he gained his ability as a Parselmouth in an unorthodox manner).<ref name="DH35"/>

==Characteristics==
Parseltongue is, when spoken, a hissing sound, similar to that of a snake; as such, normal people cannot understand it<ref name="COS11"/> (one known exception being [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]).<ref name="bloomsburychat" /> Apart from merely communicating with serpentine lifeforms, Parselmouths also seem able to influence the will of serpents to a certain extent.<ref name="COS11"/><ref name="COS17"/> Aside from serpent-based creatures, Parselmouths can communicate with each other with the language, as Harry understood [[Tom Riddle]]'s commands to the [[Serpent of Slytherin]],<ref name="COS17"/> and the [[House of Gaunt]] communicate with each other almost exclusively in Parseltongue.<ref name="HBP10">{{HBP|B|10}}</ref> While inherited, Parseltongue usually requires the speaker to face a snake-based creature or object shaped like a snake (e.g. a carving); more proficient speakers may be able to speak it at will, as the Gaunt family was very proficient in the language ''—'' enough so for Morfin to speak to [[Bob Ogden]] with it,<ref name="HBP10"/> while Voldemort could speak to the [[Statue of Slytherin]] to release the basilisk.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

{{Quote|The boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he's trustworthy?|[[Cornelius Fudge]]'s prejudice against Parselmouths|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
The ability to actually speak Parseltongue — not just imitate it as Ron Weasley did — is considered an attribute of a [[Dark Wizard]],<ref name="COS11"/><ref name="GOF31"/> which is partly due to the fact that both [[Salazar Slytherin]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] possessed this ability.<ref name="COS11"/><ref name="COS17"/> Another notable Dark Wizard who was also a Parselmouth was [[Herpo the Foul]].<ref name="FBR"/> However, as Albus Dumbledore pointed out, there are Parselmouths among the good as well, the most well-known of which was [[Harry Potter]]. [[Phillipus von Hohenheim|Paracelsus]], a notable [[Alchemy|alchemist]] and a "medical genius", is credited with the discovery of Parseltongue in the [[16th century|sixteenth century]],<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref> despite the existence of speakers like [[Herpo the Foul]] or [[Salazar Slytherin]] in the classical and medieval ages. Because of the uncommonness of Parselmouths, Voldemort came to believe it made him special.<ref name="HBP13">{{HBP|B|13}}</ref>

An unknown member of the [[Dark Force Defence League]] once stated when asked regarding the matter by [[Rita Skeeter]] — "''Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are historically associated with evildoers''."<ref name="GOF31">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref>

==Harry Potter as a Parselmouth==
{{Quote|I spoke a different language? But — I didn’t realise — how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?|[[Harry Potter]] after he speaks Parseltongue|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] passed the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue on to [[Harry Potter]] when he [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|attacked]] him in infancy in [[1981]], inadvertently and unknowingly making him into a [[Horcrux]].<ref name="DH35">{{DH|B|35}}</ref> Harry first experienced conversation with [[snake]]s at age ten when he was taken to the zoo with his cousin [[Dudley Dursley]] and found himself communicating with a snake while in the reptile exhibit. Harry [[Underage magic|inadvertently caused]] the glass of the snake's tank to vanish, enabling it to escape.<ref name="PS2">{{PS|B|2}}</ref>

[[File:Parseltongue snake.gif|237x237px|thumb|left|Harry speaking Parseltongue during the Duelling Club]]

Harry was not consciously aware of his ability to speak Parseltongue until [[1992]]; he was pitted against [[Draco Malfoy]] in the [[Duelling Club]] and was able to communicate with the snake Draco [[Snake Summons Spell|conjured to attack him]], telling it not to attack [[Justin Finch-Fletchley]].<ref name="COS11"/> This caused hysteria among his fellow students because [[Writing on the Wall|writing on the walls]] of [[Hogwarts Castle]] foretold that the [[Tom Riddle|Heir of Slytherin]] would open the [[Chamber of Secrets]], unleashing a [[Serpent of Slytherin|monster]] that would attack the school's [[Muggle-born]] students.<ref name="COS9">{{COS|B|9}}</ref> Even [[Severus Snape]], who was previously enjoying Harry's horror at the snake, became horrified himself when he learned of Harry's ability to communicate with snakes.<ref name="COS11"/> The Heir of Slytherin was in fact Voldemort, but Harry was able to gain access to the Chamber by speaking the [[password]] in Parseltongue, and subsequently killed the basilisk within. It was shortly after this incident that Harry learned how he acquired the ability.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

When the wizarding world discovered Harry's ability to speak Parseltongue, courtesy of [[Rita Skeeter]], people began to doubt his words, as [[Cornelius Fudge]] refused to believe Harry's claim of Voldemort's rebirth partially due to being prejudiced to Harry's ability to speak the language.<ref name="GOF36">{{GOF|B|36}}</ref>

Harry also used his skill in Parseltongue to open [[Salazar Slytherin's Locket]].<ref name="DH19">{{DH|B|19}}</ref> When Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] returned to Hogwarts to search for [[Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem]], Ron managed a weak imitation of Parseltongue to re-open the Chamber of Secrets so that he and Hermione could fetch basilisk fangs, which Hermione used to destroy [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]].<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

After Lord Voldemort destroyed the fragment of his [[soul]] residing in Harry, Harry seemingly lost the ability to speak Parseltongue, about which he was glad and relieved.<ref name="bloomsburychat">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html July 30, 2007 Bloomsbury Live Chat with J. K. Rowling]</ref>

Harry Potter never tried to use again the ability during the next twenty-two years, but in 2020, despite his previous belief that the ability was lost forever to him, Harry had somehow regained the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue again if he truly ever lost it in the first place. While initially reluctant to do so and only after Hermione insisted that he had to try, Harry successfully spoke Parseltongue to open the enchanted room of [[Delphini]] while searching for his missing son, [[Albus Potter]]. Later, in order to impersonate the Dark Witch's father, Lord Voldemort, Harry again used his ability to speak Parseltongue.<ref name="cursedchild" />

===Unconfirmed potential Parselmouths===
The ability to speak Parseltongue being known to be hereditary, the blood relatives of known Parselmouths are potentially Parselmouths themselves.

*[[Rionach Steward]]<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />

===Other instances of Parseltongue===
[[File:Bathilda Bagshot and Harry Potter.jpg|220px|thumb|Harry and [[Bathilda Bagshot]]'s body inhabited by [[Nagini]] speak Parseltongue]]
People who were not Parselmouths but were able to speak or understand Parseltongue through various means:
*[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] was able to speak Parseltongue while she was possessed by [[Tom Riddle's Diary]], which enabled her to open the [[Chamber of Secrets]].<ref name="COS17" />
*[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] was also able to open the Chamber of Secrets during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] by repeating a fragment of Parseltongue he had heard Harry Potter use to open [[Salazar Slytherin's Locket]], though it took him several tries to make it work.<ref name="DH31" />
*[[Albus Dumbledore]] could understand Parseltongue and repeat sentences in it verbatim; he may have been able to speak it in full, although this is unconfirmed.<ref name="bloomsburychat" />
*[[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] mentioned in his magnum opus, ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', that information on [[Runespoor]]s, three-headed snakes from [[Africa]], is based on the “writings of Parselmouths who have kept and conversed with these serpents”.<ref name="FBR"/> There are likely to be African Parselmouths completely unrelated to the Gaunts.
*[[Bathilda Bagshot]]'s carcass spoke in Parseltongue while it was occupied by [[Nagini]].<ref name="DH17">{{DH|B|17}}</ref>
*[[Isolt Sayre]], a direct descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]], was able to understand a [[Horned Serpent]] which she regularly visited but was not able to speak Parseltongue herself.<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that she took the name Parselmouth from an "old word for someone who has a problem with the mouth, like a [[Wikipedia:hare lip|hare lip]]".<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm 2003 Albert Hall Interview with J.K. Rowling] at [[Accio Quote!|Accio Quote]]</ref>
*When [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] went to [[Godric's Hollow]] in [[1997]], [[Nagini]] (inside the corpse of [[Bathilda Bagshot]]) tells Harry to "''Come!''" from the next room in Parseltongue. In reaction, Hermione jumps and clutches Harry's arm, and the two of them obey the command.<ref name="DH17"/> It is unknown how Hermione seemed to understand this command, though it could be that she did not hear it well, and merely followed Harry. She could also have been frightened by the hissing sound she heard and then followed [[Harry Potter|Harry]].
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|''Philosopher's Stone'' film]], Harry converses with a Burmese python, rather than a Boa Constrictor.
*Whenever it was spoken in the films, Parseltongue went untranslated except for one scene in {{DH|F2}} when Voldemort was speaking to Nagini, where it was given subtitles. It was also heard in English in the first film when Harry was talking in the zoo.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|films]], Parseltongue is depicted as sounding like a sibilant-filled language with readily discernible phonemes created by [[Francis Nolan|Dr Francis Nolan]] (as listed in the credits for {{DH}}). In the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|novels]], it is only ever described as a low hissing noise, easily missed by non-Parselmouths — a far cry from the rather loud versions from the films. 
*In the last two films, as Harry draws near a Horcrux he can hear, in addition to a whining noise, a faint voice which seems to speak in Parseltongue.
*It is possible that Parseltongue comes in variants for different languages, rather than being understood as the language spoken by the Parselmouth. The boa constrictor that Harry Potter converses with at the zoo uses the Portuguese word ''amigo'' rather than the English ''friend''.
