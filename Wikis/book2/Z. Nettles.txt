'''Madam Z. Nettles''' was a [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived in [[Topsham]].<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

==Biography==
She was apparently a mediocre witch, and could not remember [[incantation]]s or mix [[potion]]s. She took a [[Kwikspell]] course to improve her [[magic]]al skills. According to a testimonial she wrote for the company, the course helped her to improve her skills, as she became the centre of attention at parties and her friends begged her for the recipe of her [[Scintillation Solution]].<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>
