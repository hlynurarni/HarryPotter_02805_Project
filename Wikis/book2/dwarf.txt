{{Quote|I've got a musical message to deliver to 'Arry Potter in person.|A Dwarf attempts to give [[Ginevra Weasley's Valentine to Harry Potter|a Valentine's letter]] to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
A '''Dwarf''' is a short, stocky [[human]]oid [[magic]]al [[creature]]; little is known about them, though they are known to be extremely strong for their size, as one had held [[Harry Potter]] by his ankles to give him a letter.<ref name="COS13"/>

==History==
On [[Valentine's Day]] in [[1993]], [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[professor]] [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], had a whole squad of Dwarfs dressed up as cupids deliver singing valentines around the school, [[Ginevra Weasley's Valentine to Harry Potter|one of which]] was delivered to [[Harry Potter]] from [[Ginevra Weasley]].<ref name="COS13">{{COS|B|13}}</ref> Later that year, Harry also spotted a few raucous Dwarfs in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] in [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="POA4">{{POA|B|4}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==

*In the folklore of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], Dwarfs are a race of small supernatural beings who are known to be good with the [[axe]] and usually use axes to guard magnificent treasures buried deep inside the Earth for who ever is ruling over them, usually a queen. They usually look like small men with large heads, wizened faces, wearing animal (usually a sort of [[goat]]) masks, long grey beards, weapons as big as themselves, and misshapen legs and feet.<ref>{{Wikilink|Dwarf (mythology)}}</ref>
*The [[Denmark|Danish]] word "Dværg" can be translated into "midget" and "dwarf." In the Danish version of the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|fifth game]], "Dværg" is used when [[Ronald Weasley]] refers to [[first year]]s as "midgets" in the original version; hence, "Dwarf" can be seen as being used as an insult.
* [[J.K. Rowling]] uses the proper plural spelling of "dwarfs" in her [[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter book series]], but she spelled it wrong in [[DISASTROUS OPENING CEREMONY LEADS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP SECURITY|one article]] by using J.R.R Tolkien's misspelt version of "dwarves" for one of the races in The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.
