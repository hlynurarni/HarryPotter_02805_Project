'''Father Christmas''' (also known as '''Santa Claus''' or simply '''Santa''') is a mythological figure associated with [[Christmas]],Â who is typically portrayed as a jolly old man with a long, white beard.<ref name="wiki1">"{{wikilink|Santa Claus}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Father Christmas.png|190px|thumb|right|A Father Christmas statue on display at [[Ginzberg Delaunay]] in December 1926]]
A statue of Father Christmas was on display at the [[Ginzberg Delaunay]] department store in [[New York]] in December [[1926]].<ref name="fb1">{{FB|F}}</ref>

[[Ronald Weasley]] remarked that the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] perception of garden gnomes resembled traditional depictions of Father Christmas while real [[gnome]]s looked quite different.<ref name="cos3">{{COS|B|3}}</ref>

[[Rubeus Hagrid]] was described as presenting his idea of having the students in [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class come down on alternate evenings to observe the [[Blast-Ended Skrewts]] and make notes about their extraordinary behaviour "with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack."<ref name="GF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

In [[1995]], while [[Harry Potter]] was staying at [[12 Grimmauld Place|12]] [[Grimmauld Place]] at over the [[Christmas]] [[Christmas holidays|holidays]], an enchanted father christmas toy on a [[broomstick]] flew around the house.<ref name="ootpf">{{OOTP|F}}</ref> The stuffed [[house-elf]] heads on the walls of the stairs leading to the upper floor were also adorned with "Father Christmas hats and beards."<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The [[United States of America|U.S.]] edition of {{COS}} published by [[Scholastic]] uses the name "{{W|Santa Claus}}".
*In {{LEGO|Y2}} the 12 Grimmauld Place model has LEGO-[[Albus Dumbledore]] like traits.
*There is a widely-discussed theory (attributed to redditor TheSortingSombrero) that Father Christmas is a wizard, that he uses [[Floo Powder]] to get down the fireplaces, that he uses a [[Time-Turner]] to get his presents delivered in one night and has the [[Philosopher's Stone]] to be immortal and to pay for the presents.<ref>[https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/news/a44042/santa-is-a-harry-potter-wizard-theory/ THEORY: Santa is Actually a Wizard from "Harry Potter"] from [https://www.seventeen.com/ Seventeen.com]</ref>
