{{Quote|My [[Lucius Malfoy|father]] told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.|[[Draco Malfoy]]'s dislike of the Weasley family|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
'''Weasley''' was the surname of a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] family in [[Great Britain]]. They were considered one of the prominent wizarding families, although their lack of money and their sympathy for [[Muggle-born]] wizards and even [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] made other wizards and witches view them scornfully. They lived in [[The Burrow]], a ramshackle house of four or five stories “a little way outside” the village of [[Ottery St Catchpole]].

They were included in the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] list, published in the ''[[Pure-Blood Directory]]'' by the [[1930s]]. However, they deplored their inclusion in the list, because they said they had ancestral ties to many interesting Muggles. Their protests earned these families the opprobrium of advocates of the pure-blood doctrine, and the epithet '[[blood traitor]]'.<ref name="PM">{{PM}}</ref>

When [[Harry Potter]] befriended [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]]'s youngest son, [[Ronald Weasley]], the Weasleys became a second family to Harry. The Burrow became Harry's home away from home and Arthur and Molly served as de facto godparents in [[Sirius Black]]'s absence. Harry would eventually marry into the family when he married [[Ginevra Weasley]].

==Family history==
===Early history===
{{Quote|The [[Death Eaters]] know Ron's with you now, they're bound to target the family — don't apologise. It was always a matter of time, Dad's been saying so for months. We're the biggest blood traitor family there is.|The family and how they are viewed|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}The Weasleys (unlike many other [[pure-blood]] families) willingly associated with [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], Muggle-borns, and half-bloods and do not consider themselves superior to others because of their blood status. Thus, elitist pure-blood families such as the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] and the [[House of Black|Blacks]] consider them "[[blood traitor]]s" and treat them with disdain; [[Cedrella Black]] was even disowned by her family for marrying [[Septimus Weasley]].<ref name="BFT">[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref> Despite being "one of the biggest blood traitor" families, they seemed rather proud of it.

The Weasleys tended to have large numbers of children; an unusual trait for wizarding families, according to [[Draco Malfoy]].<ref name="CS">{{COS}}</ref> Ron's generation of Weasleys were considered poor by wizarding standards;<ref>{{PS}}</ref> their [[Weasley Vault|vault]] at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] only contained a small pile of Sickles and a single Galleon as of 1992.<ref>{{COS|B|4}}</ref>

For several generations, only boys were born into the family, until the birth of Ginevra Molly Weasley.<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7 Some Random Facts About the Weasley Family] J.K. Rowling's Website</ref> This trend ended with the grandchildren of Arthur and Molly, who include more girls than boys.

===Recent history===
{{Quote|Red hair, and a hand-me-down-robe? You must be a Weasley|The Weasleys are financially poor|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}Arthur Weasley was born on [[6 February]],<ref name="BD">[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-birthdays.html Mugglenet - JKR Birthday Archive]</ref> [[1950]]<ref name="PM-DOB">{{PM}} - [https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/arthur-weasley Explore the story: Arthur Weasley]</ref> to [[Septimus Weasley|Septimus]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella Weasley]] (née [[House of Black|Black]]).<ref>Although it has never been confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on [[Sirius Black]]'s statement in Ch. 6 of {{OOTP}} that Arthur was "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree because both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown. See also this [[Talk:Cedrella Black|talk page]] and an [http://www.hplex.info/essays/essay-black-family-tree.html HPL essay] for more information.</ref> Arthur had at least two brothers. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from 1961-1968 and was sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. In his third year in 1963, he probably chose to take [[Muggle Studies]], due to his interest in [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. While at school, he met and began dating fellow Gryffindor [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]].

===First Wizarding War===
[[File:The Burrow.png|183x183px|thumb|left|[[The Burrow]]]]
Shortly after graduating from Hogwarts, Arthur and Molly married. Their marriage was rather rushed, as [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was gaining power during that time and the [[First Wizarding War]] began.<ref name="HBP">{{HBP}}</ref> They presumably took up residence at the Burrow, since at least [[1970]]. The Burrow quickly became home to the Weasleys. Despite being poor, none of the family seemed ashamed of their home and it had a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. It was a welcoming place, and friends of the family were regular visitors. 

Arthur and Molly were not members of the first [[Order of the Phoenix]]; it is unknown if he was otherwise involved in the war. However, Molly's brothers, [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], joined the Order, and were eventually killed by five Death Eaters, one of whom was [[Antonin Dolohov]]. During the course of the war, Arthur and Molly had seven children: [[William Weasley|Bill]] in late 1970, [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]] in 1972, [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] in 1976, twins [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley|George]] in 1978, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] in 1980, and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] in 1981. Molly had longed to have a daughter after having her first five sons, but had another son before finally having a daughter.

The war ended soon after Ginny's birth, but not before Molly's brothers [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], both Order members, were murdered by [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref> The Prewett brothers were ambushed by five Death Eaters and fought like "heroes". The family was upset when some Death Eaters, such as [[Lucius Malfoy]], were able to get off scot-free by claiming that they had been under the [[Imperius Curse]]. Arthur believed they were lying, and he and Lucius were hostile towards one another whenever they crossed paths.

===Between the wars===
{{Quote|Another Weasley, eh? I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the [[Forbidden Forest|forest]].|[[Rubeus Hagrid]] regarding [[Fred and George Weasley]] to their brother Ron|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Weasley family.png|240x240px|thumb|Some members of the Weasley family. From left to right, up: Fred (or George), George (or Fred), Arthur; down: Molly, Ron, Ginny, Percy]]

The Weasleys have a long history of being Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. Molly and Arthur, along with their seven children, were all Sorted into the House. During their time at Hogwarts, all their first five children distinguished themselves: Bill was appointed Prefect in his fifth years and Head Boy in his seventh year and distinguished himself as a student, earning twelve O.W.L.s; Charlie also was a Prefect, and in addition he was Captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] and a skilled [[Seeker]] (according to Oliver Wood, he could have played for the National Team); Percy was Prefect and Head Boy as well, and in addition a distinguished student (he earned top grades in his N.E.W.T.s); Fred and George were in the Quidditch team and according to Ron they received good marks during their early years, but mostly they were well known for their creativity.

Ron felt dismay at being the sixth Weasley child to pass through Hogwarts. A large part of Ron's worries are caused by the fact that so many of the earlier Weasley children had excelled in some way or other. Ron eventually became a Prefect and a member of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], as did Ginny.

The Weasleys also became close to [[Harry Potter]] and the Muggle-born witch [[Hermione Granger]], both Ron's best friends. Harry became an unofficial member of the family, receiving traditional [[Weasley jumper]]s and was even gifted with Fabian Prewett's watch when he turned seventeen. Molly was frequently as protective of him, as she was of her own children. Molly's [[boggart]] was the corpses of her children, which included Harry. Later in life, both Harry and Hermione officially became members of the family, when he married Ginny and she married Ron sometime after the Second Wizarding War.

===Second Wizarding War===
The Weasleys' views led to their support to the [[Order of the Phoenix]] and [[Dumbledore's Army]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. In 1996 Ron and Ginny both fought in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]], receiving minor injuries for their efforts. In 1997 Bill, Ron, and Ginny also fought in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]]. During the battle Bill was savaged by [[Fenrir Greyback]], though he was not turned into a werewolf, he did develop some wolfish tendencies such as a liking for very rare steaks. Also in 1997 Arthur, Bill, Fred, George, and Ron all fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], which resulted in George's ear being cut off from Dark magic. Bill married [[Fleur Delacour]] on 1 August 1997, although their wedding was disrupted by the arrival of Death Eaters following the fall of the Ministry of Magic

[[File:Orderbattle.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The Weasleys arrive with the Order just before the start of the Battle of Hogwarts]]

Arthur also participated in covert missions, such as guarding the prophecy regarding Harry on Dumbledore's orders. Bill also took a desk job at Gringotts in an attempt to persuade goblins to the Order of the Phoenix's side. In addition, Charlie worked as a recruiter. He spend much of his time trying to convince foreign wizards to join the fight against Voldemort, operating out of Romania. The Weasleys also opened their home to the Order, the Burrow replaced [[12 Grimmauld Place]].

During the height of the latter conflict, the Weasleys were placed under surveillance by the [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]-controlled [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] because they had been in close contact with Harry, and eventually had to go into hiding. Fred and George participated in ''[[Potterwatch]]'' a radio programme designed to raise moral in the fight against Voldemort and lend support to Harry. The Weasleys took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. During the battle Fred was killed, deeply upsetting the rest of the family,<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref> and his death was enough to make his mother commit murder to save her daughter from the same fate.

===After the war===
[[File:Epilogue scene family gathering.png|245px|thumb|The Weasley family expanded after the war]]

The families financial status likely changed with the great commercial success of [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] and the successful careers of various family members. By the twenty-first century, many Weasleys and their relatives worked for the Ministry of Magic, including Arthur, Percy, Ron, and their in-laws [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]].<ref>[http://bibliophilists.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/highlights-of-jk-rowlings-us-book-tour/ J.K. Rowling's U.S. Book Tour]</ref> The Weasley family also saw an expansion, as Molly and Arthur's children started having kids of their own.

Bill continued his work as a [[Curse-Breaker|Curse Breaker]]. Charlie remained unmarried and proceeded to study dragons. Percy eventually became Head of the [[Department of Magical Transportation]]. George remained at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes and would never recover from the loss of his twin. Ron became an Auror after the war and retired after two years in order to join George at the shop. Ginny became a Chaser for the [[Holyhead Harpies]]. She eventually retired in order to start a family with Harry and became a sports editor and Quidditch correspondent for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.

==Family members==
===Main family===
[[Arthur Weasley]], one of three sons of [[Septimus Weasley|Septimus]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella Weasley]]<ref>Although it has never been confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on [[Sirius Black]]'s statement in Ch. 6 of {{OOTP}} that Arthur waste "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree because both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.

They married soon after finishing school and went on to have seven children, whom they loved but did not spoil. All of those who were of age, except Percy, eventually became members of the reinstated [[Order of the Phoenix]].

{{Weasleyfamilytree}}[[File:Weasleyfamilytree-jessicaroux-72nowm.jpg|308x308px|thumb]]
<gallery>

</gallery>

==Etymology==
*There appears to be a pattern in the Weasley family of members having names that may possibly allude to figures in medieval history and Arthurian legend:
**[[Arthur Weasley]], shares a given name with {{wplink|King Arthur}}, the central character of Arthurian legends.
**The eldest son, [[William Weasley|Bill]], has the same given name as [[Wikipedia:William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (2nd Creation)|William Marshal]]. Between the mid 12th and early 13th centuries, this knight rose from obscurity by serving four [[Wikipedia:House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet kings of England]] ([[Wikipedia:Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[Wikipedia:Richard I of England|Richard I]], [[Wikipedia:John, King of England|John]] and [[Wikipedia:Henry III of England|Henry III]]), and eventually became Regent of England. At times, he is referred to as "the Flower of Chivalry." In {{DH}}, Bill marries [[Fleur Delacour]], whose name translates as "flower of the court".
**[[Charles Weasley]]'s name may be a reference to {{wplink|Charlemagne}}.
**[[Fred Weasley]]'s name is a diminutive of the name Frederick, which may be an allusion to[[Wikipedia: Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor| Frederick Barbarossa]]. Frederick was an Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, served in both the Second and Third Crusades. His nickname, Barbarossa, means "red beard."
**[[George Weasley]]'s name may be a reference to St George.
**[[Percy Weasley]]'s name is a diminutive of the name ''{{wplink|Percival}}'', which was the name of one of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table.
**[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] connects into this pattern of medieval and Arthurian naming in three ways:
***Firstly, he shares his name with King Arthur's spear Rhongomyniad, which {{wplink|Geoffrey of Monmouth}} called "Ron."
***If one were to take the name Ronald and switch the "n" and "l," they would have {{wplink|Roland}}. Historically Roland was a military leader under Charlemagne and was responsible for defending the [[Wikipedia:Francia|Frankish Kingdom]]'s border with Brittany. Brittany is considered a potential place of origin for many of the Arthurian legends. Later, he became the subject of a [[Wikipedia:The Song of Roland|chanson de geste]], which is considered one of the earliest pieces of French literature, and was popular throughout the medieval era.
***The name Ronald is derived from an Old Norse name that was a cognate of the name [[Wikipedia:Reginald (given name)|Reginald]]. This connection is supported when Ron uses [[Polyjuice Potion]] to masquerade as [[Reginald Cattermole]] while [[Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|infiltrating the Ministry of Magic]] in {{DH}}. During 12th century, there were two Reginalds that this cognitive naming may be an allusion to:
****{{wplink|Reginald of Durham}} was a monk who chronicled the life of [[Wikipedia:Godric of Finchale|Saint Godric of Finchale]], who shares a given name with [[Godric Gryffindor]], founder of [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]].
****{{wplink|Raynald of Châtillon}} (Raynald is also a cognate of Reginald), served in the Second Crusade and ruled as {{wplink|Prince of Antioch}} until he was captured and executed by [[Wikipedia:Saladin|Saladin]]. While discussing the [[Deathly Hallows]] with Harry and Hermione, Ron states that he favours the [[Elder Wand]], whose original wielder was [[Antioch Peverell]].
**[[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]'s full name is ''{{wplink|Ginevra}}'', the Italian form of the name {{wplink|Guinevere}}, who was Arthur's queen.
**Also, [[Muriel]] had a cousin named [[Lancelot (disambiguation)|Lancelot]], who was [[Wikipedia:Lancelot|one of Arthur's knights]], though it should be noted that Muriel is only related to the Weasleys by the marriage of her niece [[Molly Weasley|Molly]].

==Author's comments==
[[File:Weasleys.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Fred and George Weasley]]]]
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has said that unlike with many other characters, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s name always remained the same in various drafts of the series. She has remarked that the surname ''Weasley'' is derived from the {{wplink|weasel}}, which is also [[Arthur Weasley]]'s [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. About the family's name and characteristic red hair, she commented:
:''"In Britain and Ireland the weasel has a bad reputation as an unfortunate, even malevolent, animal. However, since childhood I have had a great fondness for the family ''mustelidae''; not so much malignant as maligned, in my opinion. There are also many superstitions associated with redheaded people and most state that they are in some way unlucky (Judas Escariot was supposedly red-haired), but this is nonsense; I happen to like red hair as well as weasels."''<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7 "Extra Stuff: The Weasley Family"] at {{JKRS}}</ref>

*[[Hermione Granger]]'s [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] is an [[otter]], which is in the same family as the weasel, ''Mustelidae''. This, as well as the fact that the Weasleys live in [[Ottery St Catchpole]], may have foreshadowed her marriage into the family.
**Her nephew [[Albus Potter]] owns a pet ferret, which is also in the same family as the weasel.
*Weasley sounds like weaver, convenient considering that [[Molly Weasley|Mrs Weasley]] loves to knit, or at least charm her needles to do it for her.

*The only sons of [[Arthur Weasley]] and [[Molly Weasley]] that do not have any known children are [[Fred Weasley]] and [[Charles Weasley]], the former because of his death and the latter because he is much more interested in studying dragons.
*The Weasleys own a [[tractor]].
*[[Harry Potter]] has saved several lives of members of the Weasley family, something Arthur and Molly gratefully pointed out, and believed it was lucky that Ron chose to sit in the same cabin on their first day at the Hogwarts Express.
**He destroyed [[Tom Riddle's diary]] before Ginny had her life force drained away.
**He saw Arthur being attacked by Nagini and reported it in time to save him.
**He gave Ron a [[Bezoar]] when he was poisoned.
**He shielded Molly when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] turned on her after she killed [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
*Along with the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Granger family]], the Weasleys are also related to the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Evans family]] and the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Dursley family]]. They are related to the Evans and Dursleys through [[Harry Potter]], who married Ginny.
*The only children who may call the Weasleys their "maternal family" are the children of Ginny: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna Potter.
*It is possible that [[Victoire Weasley]], Bill and Fleur&apos;s daughter, might marry [[Edward Lupin|Teddy Lupin]], making the Weasleys related to the [[Lupin family]] in two ways: from the marriage of Victoire and from sharing distant ancestry through the [[House of Black|Black family]].
*J.K. Rowling said in an interview that Molly Weasley educated her children in the basics (reading, maths, spelling, grammar, etc.) before they went to Hogwarts.<ref>[http://www.beyondhogwarts.com/story.20040304.html Beyond Hogwarts - J.K. Rowling gives revealing answers in World Book Day chat]</ref>
*If the young man seen beside Tonks in the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] scene in {{DH|F1}} is in fact Charlie, that would mean that this is the second film (along with [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]) in which all nine Weasleys appear.
*The oldest child, Bill has his father's first name, Arthur, as his middle name and the youngest child, Ginny, has her mother's first name, Molly, as her middle name.
*Orange hair was considered a sign of witchcraft in medieval times.
*According to [https://houseofnames.com/Weasley-family-crest houseofnames.com], the Weasley family originally hailed from Normandy in [[Frances de la Tour|France]]. This would make the Weasley family potentially ''older'' than even the [[House of Black]], as the Blacks are French in origin, dating back to High Medieval times while the invasion by William the Conqueror is ''early'' Medieval (1066 AD).
