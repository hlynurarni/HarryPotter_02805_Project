{{quote|It’s a disgusting thing to call someone. Dirty blood, see. Common blood.|Explanation of the term “Mudblood”|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

'''Mudblood''' is a highly derogatory term for a [[Muggle-born]] or [[half-blood]]<ref>https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1040526726835650560</ref> [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]]; that is, individuals with no wizarding relatives. There does not appear to be any difference in the [[magic]]al power of Muggle-borns and half-bloods compared to those who are [[pure-blood]], but [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacists]] consider them to be of "lower breeding" or worth, and undeserving of magic. The racial slur implies that the individual has "dirty blood" and is considered extremely offensive. There are apparently other, less commonly used terms with a similar meaning, such as "creature of dirt".<ref name="OP6">{{OOTP|B|6}}</ref>

==History==

===Use by prejudiced witches and wizards===
{{quote|No one asked your opinion, you filthy Mudblood.|[[Draco Malfoy]] throwing the slur at Hermione Granger|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Hermione's Arm Mudblood.gif|251x251px|thumb|left|[[Bellatrix Lestrange]] carved the slur into [[Hermione Granger]]'s arm]]

Many older wizarding families place great emphasis on [[Blood status|blood purity]] and reject association with [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and [[Muggle-born]]s, both of whom they consider greatly inferior to themselves.<ref>In the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221500/https://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=58. F.A.Q. section] of her [[J. K. Rowling's official site|website]], [[J. K. Rowling]] stated that "As far as somebody like Lucius Malfoy is concerned, for instance, a Muggle-born is as 'bad' as a Muggle."</ref> The notion is foremost in the minds of [[Dark Wizard]]s, [[Death Eaters]], and other followers of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It is possible that some well-meaning pureblood families espouse this prejudice as well, but to a less virulent degree. Notably, some pure-bloods, such as members of the [[Weasley family]], reject these prejudices and are labelled "[[blood traitor]]s" or "[[Mudblood-lover]]s" as a result.

The term "Mudblood" is generally not used in polite society, as it is considered highly offensive and vulgar, on par with the racial epithets often heard in the Muggle world. When Draco Malfoy called [[Hermione Granger]] a Mudblood in 1992, he was nearly attacked by several members of the [[Gryffindor]] [[Quidditch]] [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|team]] and was nearly cursed by [[Ronald Weasley]].<ref name="COS7">{{COS|B|7}}</ref> However, when Voldemort was in control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in 1997, the term became more prevalent, appearing even in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' and Ministry [[Mudbloods and the Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society|propaganda]]. This was in line with [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] ideology being disseminated to the general public, which claimed that Muggle-borns were not "real" wizards and witches.<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

===Use by Muggle-borns===
{{dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I’m a Mudblood!|Ron Weasley|Don't call yourself —|Why shouldn’t I? Mudblood, and proud of it!|Hermione's refusal to let the word bother her|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}There are some Muggle-borns who refuse to allow the term to be degrading to them. For example, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] told her former friend [[Severus Snape]] that if he was going to refer to other Muggle-borns as "Mudbloods", then he had to use the term for her as well, and [[Hermione Granger]] declared that she was proud to be a "Mudblood" in 1998.<ref name="DH" />

==Usage of the term==
{{Quote|Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born &mdash; you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards &mdash; like Malfoy's family &mdash; who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call [[pure-blood]].|Ron explaining the term|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

When Dumbledore told Draco not to use the word in his presence, Draco questioned if Dumbledore cared about him using "Mudblood" when he was about to kill Dumbledore. Like many pure-blood wizards, he is accustomed to using the term to degrade the muggle-borns.

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{COS|FA}}, after [[Draco Malfoy]] calls [[Hermione Granger]] a "filthy little Mudblood", it is shown that Hermione is already familiar with the term, which is odd, considering that it would be unlikely for her to hear it anywhere, and she and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] explain it to [[Harry Potter]]. Though it is possible that she could have learned about the word while doing research. In the novel, Hermione had never heard the word before, and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] explains it to her and Harry.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|first part of the film adaptation]] of {{DH}}, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] tortures [[Hermione Granger]] by [[Bellatrix Lestrange's knife|carving]] the word ''"mudblood"'' on her arm. No such event ever happens in the novels. However, the scene reflects an event during the Holocaust wherein identification numbers were tattooed on the arms of Jews in the concentration camps. This is due to J.K. Rowling being influenced by the horrors of Nazi Germany.
*Much like other ethnic slurs in real-life, Hermione in self-reference used the term ironically. This is similar to how many members of certain ethnic minorities use slurs that were previously used to degrade and insult them as a form of self-identification in their respective cultural lexicons, while looking poorly upon those outside their ethnic backgrounds who still continue to use such terms derogatorily.
