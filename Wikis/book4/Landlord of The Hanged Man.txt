{{Quote|War turned him funny, if you ask me.|The landlord on [[Frank Bryce]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
The '''landlord of The Hanged Man '''(fl. [[1943]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] man who ran [[the Hanged Man]] pub in [[Little Hangleton]].

==Biography==
===The Riddle murders===
The night the [[Riddle family|Riddles]] were murdered, in the summer of [[1943]], his pub was filled with villagers who wanted to gossip about the murders. After the [[Riddles' cook]] entered the pub, bringing the news of the arrest of [[Frank Bryce]], the landlord commented that the war turned Bryce funny, perhaps hinting that he believed the gardener was guilty of the murders of his employers.<ref name="GoF">{{GOF|B|1}}</ref>
