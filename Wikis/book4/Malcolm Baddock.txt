'''Malcolm Baddock''' (born c. [[1982]]-[[1983]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Slytherin]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] three years below [[Harry Potter]]. His arrival at the Slytherin table immediately after being [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] in [[1994]] was met with applause from [[Draco Malfoy]], but [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] hissed at him, and Harry privately wondered if Malcolm was aware of Slytherin House's sinister reputation.<ref name="GOF12">{{GOF|B|12}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Malcolm means "disciple of St Columba," a sixth century Irish saint who established a convent on the island of Iona. This was the name of four kings of [[Scotland]] starting in the 10th century, including Malcolm III, who became king after killing Macbeth, the usurper who had murdered his father.
