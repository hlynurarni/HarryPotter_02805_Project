{{Quote|Harry could see a village, undoubtably Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep hills, its church and [[Little Hangleton graveyard|graveyard]] clearly visible. Across the valley on the opposite hillside, was a [[Riddle House|handsome manor house]] surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.|Description|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Little Hangleton''' is a small village in [[England]], within which the most prominent family was formerly the [[Riddle family|Riddles]]. The village is six miles away from the larger community of [[Great Hangleton]]<ref>{{HBP}}</ref> and is about 200 miles away from [[Little Whinging]].<ref>{{GOF|B|1}}</ref> The [[pure-blood]] wizarding family, the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunts]], lived just outside Little Hangleton in a [[Gaunt Shack|shack]].

==Notable Places==
===The [[Riddle House]]===
{{Quote|It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.|Description of the house|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:Riddle House2.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|The Riddle house]]
The [[Riddle House]] was the home of the snobbishly unpopular Riddle family, who were Muggles, in the early twentieth century. It was the largest house in town, and the Riddles were wealthy, owning much of the land around. The son of the Riddles was [[Tom Riddle Senior]], who was bewitched by peasant witch [[Merope Riddle|Merope Gaunt]] with a love spell in 1926, leading to the conception of Tom Marvolo Riddle, who would come to be known as [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Once Merope removed the love spell, Tom Riddle Senior immediately left and paid no regard to Merope or their unborn son. Merope died in childbirth and Tom Riddle Jnr was placed in an [[Wool's Orphanage|orphanage]].

Voldemort killed his father, paternal [[Thomas Riddle|grandfather]], and [[Mary Riddle|grandmother]] in the house in [[1943]], and framed his maternal uncle [[Morfin Gaunt]] for the crime. After the murder of the Riddles, the house changed hands many times. By 1994, it was said in the village that the wealthy man who owned it neither lived there nor put it to any use, owning it for ambiguous 'tax reasons'. The only permanent resident during that time period was [[Frank Bryce]], the Riddles' gardener, who was kept on by the house's subsequent owners.

In the summer of [[1994]], after [[Peter Pettigrew]] escaped from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and found the semi-corporeal Voldemort, the two wizards returned to the Riddle house to plan for Voldemort's return to power. Whilst in the house, they plotted to have the [[Triwizard Cup]] turned into a [[Portkey]] to the local churchyard, and set into motion a plan which would end with [[Harry Potter]] captured. When Frank Bryce discovered Pettigrew and Voldemort in the house and inadvertently overheard them discussing their plans, Voldemort murdered him and fed him to [[Nagini]].

===The [[Gaunt Shack]]===
{{Quote|"It was a few seconds before Harry’s eyes discerned the building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime.|[[Harry Potter]]'s impression of the Gaunt shack |Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Bob Ogden Gaunt Shack.jpg|220x220px|thumb|The Gaunt shack]]
On the outskirts of Little Hangleton lived the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunts]], the last direct descendants of [[Salazar Slytherin]]. Years of inbreeding made the family violent and unstable, and left them in poverty. There were frequently many snakes about the property, as the Gaunts were all [[Parseltongue|Parselmouths]], like their ancestor.

The townspeople gossiped about the Gaunts and thought they were mad, while the Gaunts in turn considered the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] who lived nearby beneath them. [[Marvolo Gaunt]] died alone in the shack, after he and his son [[Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]] were briefly imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], and his daughter Merope married Tom Riddle Snr and left for [[London]]. The Gaunt shack was also the hiding place of [[Marvolo Gaunt's Ring]], which Voldemort took from his uncle and turned into a [[Horcrux]] after he murdered his paternal relatives. Years later, [[Albus Dumbledore]] visited the shack when he was seeking out Voldemort's Horcruxes, and found and ultimately destroyed the ring hidden under the rotting floorboards. A year later, when Voldemort realised that [[Harry Potter]] was seeking out his Horcruxes, he immediately returned to the shack first, believing it was the least safe, and was furious when he saw the floorboards torn open and the ring gone.

===The [[Little Hangleton graveyard|graveyard]]===
[[File:Little Hangleton graveyard GOF 2.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Little Hangleton graveyard]]
The local cemetery of Little Hangleton was the burial place for various members of the [[Riddle family]], including Tom Riddle Senior. It was also the site of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s rebirth. The [[Triwizard Cup]], turned into a [[Portkey]] by disguised [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], transported [[Harry Potter]] and [[Cedric Diggory]] there in June of [[1995]]. Peter Pettigrew killed Cedric on Voldemort's orders, and Harry's blood was then used as part of a [[Dark Arts|Dark]] ritual to [[Return of Lord Voldemort|reconstitute a body]] for Voldemort, along with Tom Riddle Senior's bones. The Dark Lord then called his servants to him with Pettigrew's [[Dark Mark]], thus reviving the [[Death Eaters]], and engaged in a [[Duelling|duel]] with Harry. Because of [[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]], Harry managed to escape Voldemort and return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] with Cedric's body.

The ritual which Voldemort and Pettigrew performed in the Little Hangleton graveyard would also play a role in Voldemort's ultimate fall from power. By taking in some of Harry's blood - blood which carried the magical protection from his [[Lily J. Potter|mother]], who sacrificed herself for him when he was an infant - Voldemort anchored Harry's life to his own. This would allow Harry to survive the [[Killing Curse]] Voldemort struck him with during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]], destroying the [[Horcrux]] within Harry and setting the stage for their final duel.

===[[The Hanged Man]]===
The Hanged Man is a local pub, in which many townspeople gossiped about the Riddle murders. Since the Riddles were slain with the [[Killing Curse]], the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] authorities could not determine the cause of death, and many people suspected that Frank Bryce had murdered them.

===[[Cottage of Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce's cottage]]===
This cottage, bordering the Little Hangleton graveyard, was the permanent residence of Frank Bryce. It was from here that he saw lights from the Riddle House in 1994, and - thinking it to be local children causing mischief - investigated, leading to his death.

==Known residents==
*[[Frank Bryce]]
*[[Dot]]
*[[Rod Freddy]]
*[[House of Gaunt|The Gaunts]]
*[[Riddle family|The Riddles]]

*The [[Landlord of The Hanged Man|local barman]]

==Etymology==
''Hangleton'' derives from "hangle", an iron pothook<ref>See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangle this online definition].</ref> and "''-ton''", a suffix meaning "town" and which is thus often used in the names of municipalities.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Harry Potter]] only ever physically visited Little Hangleton during the [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Return of Tom Riddle]]; however, he went there in memories presented to him by [[Albus Dumbledore]] quite a few times. Also, despite being in Little Hangleton again, through memories, Harry doesn't recognise the graveyard.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Little Hangleton always seems to have a dark, shadowy landscape with cloudy weather. Though there is no mention in the book, it is possible that it was made to add in with the murderous history that occured in the village.
*Little Whinging is in the far northwestern corner of Surrey (since Harry had travelled there by way of Paddington Station). A circle drawn of 200 miles would point out to the ocean, but the line crosses some parts of Wales, York, Cornwall and Middleborough, indicating that Little Hangleton is located somewhere in the midsection of England, though it is unknown exactly where the village is located.
