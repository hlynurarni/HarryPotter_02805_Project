A veritable legion of '''[[House-elf|house-elves]]''' are enlisted by [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. They work in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchens]], preparing feasts for the entire school. They also move trunks and baggage to and from rooms, clean dormitories, and presumably other areas of the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] as well. They wear [[toga]]s made of tea-towels bearing the Hogwarts crest.<ref name="GOF21">{{GOF|B|21}}</ref> When asked nicely, they will accommodate the dietary requests of vegetarian students.<ref name="accio">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm 2000 Interview with JK Rowling]</ref>

==History==
===Helga Hufflepuff===
[[Helga Hufflepuff]] brought the House-elves to work in the [[Hogwarts kitchens]] as a way of ensuring they could work and not be abused.<ref name="PC">[[J.K. Rowling PotterCast Interview]] - ''"Yeah, it's a complicated issue. I would say that [[Helga Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff]] gave — Hufflepuff did what was the most moral thing to do at that time, and we are talking about over a thousand years ago. So that would be to give them good conditions of work."''</ref>

===1994===
{{Quote|At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen, bowing and curtseying as [[Dobby]] led [[Harry Potter|Harry]] past them.|The [[house-elf|house-elves]] in [[1994]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In [[1994]], [[Dobby]], a house-elf, was hired by [[Albus Dumbledore]] to work in the kitchens for a [[Galleon]] a week. Another house-elf named [[Winky]], took up work at Hogwarts as well, but during her time there she had turned into a heavy drinker. They soon became titled as Hogwarts house-elves although the other House Elves were disconcerted by them.<ref name="GOF21"/>

In the same year, [[Hermione Granger]] set up the organisation [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|S.P.E.W.]], she started coming to the kitchens in order to persuade them to be set free. This did not earn her any popularity, as most believe that house-elves enjoy their work; indeed, even the house-elves did not like her campaigning. She started knitting hats and socks, which she left lying around [[Gryffindor Tower]], hoping to free some unsuspecting elf who picked them up while cleaning the common room, so as to grant them freedom. The house-elves did not appreciate this gesture; on the contrary, they took it for insult and refused to clean the [[Gryffindor Common Room]], with the exception of [[Dobby]]. They became angry with Hermione Granger as she made these attempts to free them.<ref name="GOF21"/>

===1998===
{{quote|Fight, fight for my master, the defender of the house-elves! Fight for brave Regulus! Fight!|[[Kreacher]] leading the house-elves during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
They participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] in an unusually bold move for their kind, although this may have been a manifestation of their extreme loyalty to their "masters". They fought with knives and cleavers, hacking at the shins of [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>
