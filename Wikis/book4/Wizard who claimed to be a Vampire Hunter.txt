{{Dialogue a-b|[[Wizard who claimed to be a dragon killer|Friend]]|I pull down about a hundred sacks of [[Galleon]]s a year! I'm a [[dragon killer]] for the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]].|Wizard|No, you're not! You're a dishwasher at the [[Leaky Cauldron]] … but I'm a [[Vampire Hunter]], I've killed about ninety so far - |A group of wizards fighting over the affections of a group of Veelas.|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]] between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Ireland]]. He claimed that he was a [[Vampire Hunter]] in an attempt to impress a group of [[Veela]], after refuting the claims of [[Wizard who claimed to be a dragon killer|his friend]] who said he was a [[dragon killer]].<ref>{{GOF|B|9}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is extremely unlikely that the "vampire hunter"'s claim was true given that killing vampires is illegal under the [[Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans]] (paragraph twelve). However, very dangerous vampires were killed at times, as shown in the case of [[Herbert Varney]]
