'''Ogg''' was the [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|gamekeeper]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during [[Arthur Weasley]] and [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]]'s time at the school.<ref name="GOF31"/>

==History==
After [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was expelled in [[1943]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] convinced [[Armando Dippet]] to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper.<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref> Hagrid presumably served as Ogg's assistant before Ogg left the position and Hagrid was promoted.

In [[1995]], Molly became intrigued by the [[Whomping Willow]] when she visited Harry Potter during the [[Triwizard Tournament#The Third Task|third task]], and she reminisced at length about Ogg.<ref name="GOF31">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref>
