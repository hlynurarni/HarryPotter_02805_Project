'''Mr Hornby''' was the brother of [[Olive Hornby]]. [[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]] showed up uninvited at his wedding because she was haunting Olive, his sister, and apparently made a scene to remind Olive of the bullying she put up with when she was still alive. It was so big of a mess that Olive had to get help from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in getting rid of the troublesome [[ghost]].<ref name="GOF25">{{GOF|B|25}}</ref>
