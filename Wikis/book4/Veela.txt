{{Quote|Veela are semi-human magical beings; beautiful women with white-gold hair and skin that appears to shine [[moon]]-bright. When angry, Veela take on a less pleasant appearance; their faces elongate into sharp, cruel-beaked [[bird]] heads, and long scaly wings burst from their shoulders.|Description|Pottermore}}

'''Veela''' (both singular and plural) are semi-[[human]] [[magic]]al [[being]]s who appear as young, beautiful women with white-gold hair and moon-bright skin, native to [[Bulgaria]]. Their looks and especially their dance is hypnotically seductive to almost all male beings, which causes them to perform foolhardy and impulsive actions to get closer to, and to receive admiration from the Veela.<ref name="PM"/>

Veela were the mascots for the [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team]] during the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]],<ref name="GOF8"/> which indicates an Eastern European origin, although the [[Delacour family|Delacours]], who were from [[France]],<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref> are proof that they can be found all over [[Europe]].

==Nature==
{{Quote|At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his [[Omnioculars]], [[Harry Potter|Harry]] saw that they didn’t look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders —|Veela becoming angry, after having been provoked by [[Leprechaun]]s|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
Veela are described as looking like incredibly beautiful women, with moon-bright skin and white-gold hair that fans out behind them despite the absence of wind. They have the ability to [[Hypnosis|hypnotise]] and mesmerise most men with their seductive dance, who will then try to impress them.<ref name="PM"/>

Veela have their own type of [[Veela Magic|magic]] which [[Wandless magic|does not require]] a [[wand]]. When Veela are angry, however, they transform into something more like [[Harpy|Harpies]] — their faces turn into cruel-beaked [[bird]]-like heads while long scaly wings burst from their shoulders, and they can launch balls of [[fire]] from their hands. Veela seem to be quite an irascible race.<ref name="PM"/><ref name="GOF8">{{GOF|B|8}}</ref>

For example, in the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], they were easily wound up by the [[Leprechaun]]s, resulting in a fight between both teams' mascots on the pitch. The Veela were then sent off the pitch.<ref name="GOF8">{{GOF|B|8}}</ref>

==Veela hair==
[[Veela hair]] is a [[magic]]al substance, suitable as a [[Wand core|core]] for wand crafting. Renowned [[wandmaker]] [[Garrick Ollivander]] noted that he personally never used it, as he found the result to be temperamental. [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Fleur Delacour's wand|wand]] contained a single hair from her [[Apolline Delacour's mother|Veela grandmother]].<ref name="GOF18">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref>

==Cross-breeding==
[[File:112927s.jpg|226x226px|thumb|rightt|Fleur Delacour was quarter-Veela]]
Veela have been known to marry [[Wizardkind|wizards]], although it is unknown whether any have married [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. Children of these unions are [[half-Veela]], and they will [[Magic genes|inherit]] magical ability from their wizarding parent and beauty and charm from their Veela parent. Veela traits seem to persist for at least a few generations (examples being [[Apolline Delacour]], and her daughters [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] and [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]]).<ref name="DH8"/>

Apolline Delacour was a [[Half-Veela]], thus her children [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] and [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]] were quarter-Veela, and Fleur's children [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and [[Louis Weasley|Louis]] were each an one-eighth Veela; it is unknown if they inherited any specific Veela characteristics from their great-grandmother.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

It is unknown whether half-blooded Veela can throw [[fire]] or [[Trans-Species Transformation|transform]] into [[harpy]]-like [[creature]]s as their full-blooded relatives can.

==Known Veela==
*[[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[Apolline Delacour's mother|maternal grandmother]]
*At least [[Delacour sisters' cousins|two cousins]] of Fleur Delacour.<ref name="DH8"/>
*The [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team]] mascots at the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in [[1994]]. The mascots danced to hypnotise the players as well as the fans on the other team; even the referee was affected.<ref name="GOF8"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The term "Veela" is never used in the films.
*The word "Veela" is an Anglicisation of the Slavic term [[wikipedia:Vila (fairy)|Vila]].
*Veela are described as [[fairy]] or nymph-like creatures in {{wplink|Slavic mythology}}, who live in bodies of [[water]] and have power and ability over storms. They may be the [[ghost]]s of women who drowned, especially those who were betrayed by their [[love]]rs. They often appear as beautiful women, but are known to morph into swans, [[snake]]s, [[horse]]s, or [[Wolf|wolves]]. Their magically seductive speaking and singing voices hypnotise those who hear them, and they are fierce warriors. Interestingly, given that [[Fleur Delacour]]'s [[wand]] has a hair from her [[Apolline Delacour's mother|Veela grandmother]], it is said in some legends that if even one of their hairs is plucked, a Veela will either [[Death|die]] or be forced to change into a non-[[human]] shape. Veela are main features of [[Bulgaria]]n and Serbian folklore such as the story of [http://www.uzice.net/deseterac/markoivila.htm Marko Kraljevic and the Veela] ([http://web.archive.org/web/20010410072600/http://www.uzice.net/deseterac/markoivila.htm archive link]). Also see [https://archive.org/details/balladsofmarkokr00lowduoft The Ballads of Marko Kraljevic (English translation)].
**In Serbian legend they were maidens cursed by God; in Bulgaria they were girls who died before they were baptised; in Poland they were young girls floating through the air atoning for frivolous past lives.
**If the stories regarding the plucking of Wili/Vila hair hold true with regards to Veela it seems more likely the hair used in Fleur's wand would have naturally shed rather than been plucked.
*One of the questions on the 2nd Level [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] asks the examinee to identify which of five given statements is false; one of these claims that full-blooded male Veela do not exist.
*Veela are similar to the [[Wikipedia:Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] of {{wplink|Greek mythology}}. Sirens are featured in [[Wikipedia:Homer (poet)|Homer's]] ''{{wplink|The Odyssey}}'', as half-bird, sea-dwelling hybrids whose hypnotic singing causes sailors to run aground. However, in the [[Harry Potter universe]], [[Siren]]s are one of the three known species of [[Merpeople]], and, as far as we know, are unrelated to Veela.
*The [[Wikipedia:Slavic fairies#Vila|Veela]] of Slavic folklore are akin to [[Wikipedia:Fairy#Historical development|fairies]] in Germanic folklore and their beauty is somewhat reminiscent of the [[Wikipedia:Elf (Middle-earth)#Development|Elves]] of J.R.R. Tolkien's ''Legendarium'' - sometimes referred to as "fairies" in his earlier works - which were based on the fairies of Germanic lore.
