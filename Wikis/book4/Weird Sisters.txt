==History==
===1985–1986 school year===
By the [[1985–1986 school year]], Hogwarts students [[Myron Wagtail]] and [[Kirley Duke]], accompanied by [[Orsino Thruston]], had formed the band, and wanted to perform in the [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="HM2">{{HM|2|Become an Honorary Rocker}}</ref>

After the performance, Wagtail informed [[Jacob's sibling]] that they found a talented newcomer, [[Donaghan Tremlett]].<ref name="HM2"/>

===1986–1987 school year===
In [[1986–1987 school year]], the band mentioned that [[Jacob's sibling]], being known as an unofficial "[[Curse-Breaker]]", had been one of their sources of inspiration. They helped them practise their [[Frog Choir]] audition on the [[Training Grounds|training grounds]]. They then encouraged Jacob's sibling to sing in front of [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] to test their nerves. They watched and praised them for having done a great job.<ref name="HM3">{{HM|3|The Frog Choir}}</ref>

===1994–1995 school year===
Upon the announcement of the [[Yule Ball]], one of the rumours discussed in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], was that [[Albus Dumbledore]] had booked the Weird Sisters for the ball, which turned out to be true.<ref name="GOF22">{{GOF|B|22}}</ref>

On [[25 December]], [[1994]], the band performed in the [[Great Hall]] on a [[magic]]ally-appearing stage. Among the band's instruments were a set of drums, several guitars, a cello, a lute, a double bass and some bagpipes. During this performance, [[Harry Potter]] noted that all members of the band were extremely hairy and all wearing black robes that had been artfully torn.<ref name="GOFF22">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>

===1995–1996 school year===
In [[1995]], the band was popular enough that the marriage of their bass player, [[Donaghan Tremlett]], made front-page news in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name="OOTP14">{{OOTP|B|14}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{GOF|FA}}, the band which performs at the Yule Ball deliberately goes unnamed throughout the film because of a legal dispute between the film studio and Canadian folk band Wyrd Sisters.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/arts/story.html?id=ece18f65-1eb9-4829-9e2b-1d50a0dca298 Wyrd Sisters keep fighting the good fight] at canada.com (archived)</ref> The band is simply introduced as "The band that needs no introduction!", by [[Albus Dumbledore]].
**Thirteen years after the film's release, despite the legal dispute, [[Warner Bros.]] used the name to identify a trio of teenage witches in the 2018 Netflix Original Series, {{w|Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|''Chilling Adventures of Sabrina''}}.
*Members [[Merton Graves]] and [[Herman Wintringham]] do not make an appearance in the film.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, piper Gideon Crumb plays keyboards as well as bagpipes. In the book series, however, there is no mention of the band having a keyboard player.
*The band's songs were written by [[Jarvis Cocker]], who plays singer Myron Wagtail. "Do the Hippogriff" was a collaboration between Cocker and rhythm guitarist [[Jason Buckle]] (Heathcote Barbary).
*The Scottish band {{w|Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand}}, self-professed fans of the books, were originally invited to play the Weird Sisters.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1492215/20041012/franz_ferdinand.jhtml Franz Ferdinand To Play Ugly Sisters In Next 'Harry Potter' Flick?], MTV</ref>
*In an interview, [[J. K. Rowling]] stated that the instruments that they played included bagpipes, cello and electric guitar and that they were Harry Potter's favourite band.<ref name="royalhall">J.K. Rowling at the Royal Albert hall, [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm available on Accio Quote!]</ref>
*At least as portrayed in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], the Weird Sisters are considered to be a [[wizard rock]] band.<ref name="pts135">{{HPPS}}, Page 135</ref>
*All appear on [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s at the Harry Potter Exhibition.

===Etymology===
*The term "''Weird Sisters''" was the name given to the three prophetic witches in the play "Macbeth," by [[William Shakespeare]] ("weïrd" being Old English for "fate" or "destiny").
**Macbeth, stated to be quite possibly the favourite Shakespeare play of [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' series]] author [[J. K. Rowling]],<ref name="leakymugglenet">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet Interview]</ref> had another allusion in {{POA|F}}, where the [[Frog Choir]] sings ''"Double Double Toil and Trouble"'', a direct quote from the play.
**Interestingly, the Spanish edition of the books refers to the band by the name ''las Brujas de Macbeth'', meaning "Macbeth's Witches".
*As it is unconfirmed as to from where J. K. Rowling got the idea for the band's name, other possibilities include:
**A variant of the name, ''{{w|Wyrd Sisters}}'', was used as the title of a 1988 ''Discworld'' novel by {{w|Terry Pratchett}}.
**A play on the heavy rock band, Twisted Sister.
