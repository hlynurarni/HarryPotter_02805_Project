[[Merchieftainess]] '''Murcus''' was a [[Selkie]] and the leader of the [[Merpeople]] who lived in the [[Great Lake|lake]] in the grounds of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="GF26"/>

==Biography==
Murcus was, presumably, born and raised in the [[Great Lake|Black Lake]] in [[Scotland]], and at some point in time was pronounced [[Merchieftainess]] of the [[Great Lake Merpeople colony|Black Lake Selkie Colony]].<ref name="GF26"/>

She witnessed the [[Triwizard Tournament#1994 Triwizard Tournament|Second Task]] of the [[Triwizard Tournament]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], watching carefully as each of the four champions struggled to achieve their task.<ref name="GF26"/> 

Thereafter, she relayed the events at the bottom of the lake to [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]], who could speak and understand [[Mermish]] and who was responsible for overseeing the task.<ref name="GF26" /> 

In [[June]] of [[1997]], she and her tribe attended the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore]], where they sung for him, a tune that despite being very chilling was clearly a lament of sorrow.<ref name="HBP30" /> It was evident to the onlookers present that she and her colony, at least, were sad to see him go.<ref name="HBP30" />

==Physical appearance==
Murcus, like the rest of her tribe, had long, wild, dark-green hair and brilliant yellow eyes that matched her teeth.<ref name="GF26"/> She was wilder and more ferocious than any of the others.<ref name="GF26"/>

==Personality and traits==
Despite her lethal and ferocious looks, she appeared to be quite caring, advising the judges to increase all of the marks of the participants in the Triwizard Tournament<ref name="GF26"/> and later singing gently as Albus Dumbledore was put to rest.<ref name="HBP30"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Spain|Spanish]] version of the fourth book, Murcus is the male with the long beard.´
