'''Ali Bashir''' was a [[saleswizard]] and merchant who eagerly wanted to export [[flying carpet]]s to [[Great Britain|Britain]]. He contacted [[Arthur Weasley]] several times, attempting to persuade him to allow the importation of carpets, but Mr Weasley told him that carpets were defined as a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] Artefact by the [[Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects]] and thus banned. Despite the fact that [[broomstick|brooms]] were the preferred method of transportation for wizards in [[Great Britain|Britain]], Bashir was confident that flying carpets could still be marketed there as a family vehicle.<ref>{{GOF|B|7}}</ref> He was eventually caught trying to smuggle carpets into the country.<ref>{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Ali" means "lofty, sublime" in Arabic. Ali was a cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and the fourth caliph to rule the Muslim world. His followers were the original Shiite Muslims, who regard him as the first rightful caliph. This name is also borne by the hero in 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves'. Also, Muhammad Ali was the name adopted by boxer Cassius Clay when he converted to Islam. [[wikipedia:Bashir|Bashir]] is an Arabic surname commonly used in Western Asia, North Africa and Southern Asia.

==Behind the scenes==
*He is most likely from [[wikipedia:Arabia|Arabia]], given his name, and that flying carpets are a popular form of transportation there.
