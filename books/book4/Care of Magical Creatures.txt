{{Quote|C'mon, now, get a move on! Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comon' up! Everyone here? Right, follow me!|[[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s first Care of Magical Creatures lesson in [[1993]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
'''Care of Magical Creatures''', also known as '''Creature Care''',<ref name="nygCC">{{See image|File:The New York Ghost FB2.png}}</ref> is an elective course at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] that can be chosen by students in their [[third year]]. [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] introduced this course in [[1927]].<ref name="nygCC"/>

In the class, students learn about a wide range of [[magic]]al [[creature]]s,<ref name="POA6"/> from [[flobberworm]]s to [[fire crab]]s, and even [[unicorn]]s and [[thestral]]s. Students are taught about feeding, maintaining, breeding, and proper treatment of these creatures and many more.

The [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]] who succeeded in achieving an [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] in the subject can later become [[Magizoologist]]s. Some well-known Magizoologists are [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]],<ref name="FBR"/> his grandson [[Rolf Scamander]], and his wife [[Luna Lovegood]].

==Class information==
{{Quote|My brother Charlie was the outdoors type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures.|[[Percy Weasley]] on choosing subjects in third year|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:B3C6M3.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A third year hippogriff lesson in 1993]]
Care of Magical Creatures is a subject taught only to those in their [[third year]] or above who choose to take it as an elective course.<ref name="COS14">{{COS|B|14}}</ref><ref name="POA6"/>

In a students' [[fifth year]] they take the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] examination in the subject, where they sit both a written portion and a practical portion, were they demonstrate their knowledge of the subject. On their Care of Magical Creatures practical they have to identify a [[knarl]] hidden among a dozen hedgehogs; demonstrate correct handling of a [[bowtruckle]]; feed and clean out a [[fire crab]] without sustaining serious burns; choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick [[unicorn]].<ref name="OOTP31"/>

It is unknown how many of [[Harry Potter]]'s fellow students chose to continue Care of Magical Creatures in their [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] year; however, Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] left the subject after completing their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]].<ref name="HBP8">{{HBP|B|8}}</ref>

As of the late 20th century, many students have earned good grades in this class, something [[Albus Dumbledore]] attributed to the use of {{FB}} as a textbook.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

===Staffing===
{{Quote|I hope she stays, that woman! That’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like... proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters....|[[Parvati Patil]] praising [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank]]'s teaching skills|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Rubeus Hagrid promo.png|200px|thumb|Rubeus Hagrid, current professor of Care of Magical Creatures]]
[[Silvanus Kettleburn]] taught Care of Magical Creatures until [[1993]], when he retired "''to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs''." He was succeeded by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], whose lessons became controversial after [[Draco Malfoy]] was injured by a [[hippogriff]], [[Buckbeak]].<ref name="POA6"/> After Malfoy was injured, Hagrid was more restrained and cautious in the creatures he showed to the class for the remainder of the [[1993–1994 school year]], although Hagrid occasionally brought creatures that were illegal to class. Hermione Granger attempted to organise Hagrid's classes in order to make him a better teacher and prevent him from being fired. In his [[1994–1995 school year|second year]] of teaching the subject, Hagrid introduced the his [[fourth year]] class to [[Blast-Ended Skrewt]]s during his lessons, a species of illegally bred creatures.<ref name="GOF13"/>

During the [[1994–1995 school year]] and also the [[1995–1996 school year]], for a short time, Hagrid was substituted by [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank]], who gave lessons on [[unicorn]]s<ref name="GOF24"/> and [[bowtruckle]]s.<ref name="OOTP13"/>

==Class location==
Care of Magical Creatures classes typically take place outside of [[Hagrid's Hut]],<ref name="POA6"/> but some lessons occasionally take place in the [[Forbidden Forest]], such as the [[Thestral]] lesson.<ref name="OOTP21"/>

===Third year===
{{Quote|Harry could sort of see what Hagrid meant.

==Behind the scenes==
*As revealed in {{PM}}, [[J. K. Rowling]] had originally devised this class to be called "Beasts", and to be compulsory from the [[first year]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|hogwarts-school-subjects}}</ref>
*The year in which creatures are covered seems to depend on the teacher. Silvanus Kettleburn covered salamanders with [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] in their [[fourth year]], while Rubeus Hagrid taught about salamanders in Harry Potter's third year. Hermione Granger stated that a person like Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank probably wouldn't have covered Thestrals until reaching NEWT-level, whereas Rubeus Hagrid taught about Thestrals in Harry's fifth year.
*In {{HM}}, the class is not available until Year 4. If players take [[Jacob's sibling]] to the O.W.L. through an optional side quest, they will definitely gain at least an A, even if they fail to answer every question and care for any creatures.
