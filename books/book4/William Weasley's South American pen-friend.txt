This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who was a student that attended the [[wizarding school]] of [[Castelobruxo]] in [[Brazil]].<ref name="GOF7"/>

At some point, he became pen-friends with [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], and their two families were invited to participate in a [[student exchange programme]]. Unfortunately, due to the [[Weasley family]]'s poor financial situation, Bill was unable to go. His pen-friend was extremely offended and sent Bill a [[curse]]d hat, which made his [[Ear-shrivelling Curse|ears shrivel up]].<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>
