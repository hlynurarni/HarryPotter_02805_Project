'''Mrs Crouch''' (d.[[1980s]]) was the wife of [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch Snr]]. She participated in one of the few [[Azkaban escapes#1982|escapes]] from [[Azkaban]] in the prison's history, taking the place of her son, [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mrs Crouch was born into a [[pure-blood]] family.<ref name="Blood"/> She married [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch]] and had one son, also named [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius]]. Mr Crouch was so focused on his career within the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] that he gave little devotion to his duties as a husband and father. As such, Mrs Crouch was namely responsible for home and raising their child.<ref name="GOF27">{{GOF|B|27}}</ref>

===First Wizarding War and aftermath===
[[File:B4C30M1 Wizengamot trial Pensieve memory.png|260px|thumb|left|Mrs Crouch witnessing her son on trial]]
Shortly after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] first downfall, in [[1981]], Barty Jnr was caught amongst a group of [[Death Eaters]] who were convicted of [[Cruciatus Curse|torturing]] [[Auror]]s [[Alice Longbottom|Alice]] and [[Frank Longbottom]] into [[insanity]]. Mrs Crouch was present for her son's trial in [[Courtroom Ten]], sitting next to her husband, who presided as the judge, sobbing. She suffered the terrible and sad experience of watching her husband renounce their nineteen-year-old son and condemn him to life in [[Azkaban]] without listening to boy's crying pleas and explanations. After the sentence was passed, she collapsed in shock and grief of what had happened.<ref name="GOF30">{{GOF|B|30}}</ref>

====Rescuing her son and death====
{{Quote|My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favour to her.|Barty Jnr describing his mother's last favour.|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}About one year after their son's imprisonment, Mrs Crouch's health deteriorated drastically from the stress. In the last few weeks of her life, Mrs Crouch convinced her husband to allow her to trade places with her son in the wizard prison during their deathbed visit of their son that was permitted due to her husband's high status in the Ministry. Both mother and son drank [[Polyjuice Potion]] to take each other's appearance, and she went to Azkaban while Barty Jnr went to live in hiding with the help of their [[House-elf]] [[Winky]]. Mrs Crouch drank the remaining potion slowly and sparingly, to ensure herself not to be exposed for the other prisoners to see, and died shortly thereafter in Azkaban. She was buried by the [[Dementor]]s outside the walls under her son's name and appearance,<ref name="GOF35">{{GOF|B|35}}</ref> as [[Sirius Black]] witnessed.<ref name="GOF27"/>

===Postmortem===
Since Barty Snr could not have retrieved his wife's body from Azkaban without exposing what they had done, he staged her death, and then held a quiet, private funeral for her, with an empty grave.<ref name="GOF35"/>

Winky would use Mrs Crouch's dying wish for her son's freedom to persuade the elder Barty to allow his son attend the 422nd [[Quidditch World Cup]]. Though Crouch eventually relented, this led to a downward spiral of negative events that led to both father and son to be destroyed along with Voldemort's return to full power, leaving Mrs Crouch's efforts for her son to be tragically wasted.<ref name="GOF35"/>

==Physical appearance==
Mrs Crouch was a short, frail and wispy-looking witch.<ref name="GOF30"/> When she swapped places with her son in prison, she took on his 20-years old appearance for the remainder of her life, and died bearing his form and name.<ref name="GOF35"/>

==Personality and traits==
Mrs Crouch was a frail and emotional woman, as she was sobbing when her son was accused of crimes punishable by life sentence, to the point of fainting when her husband ruthlessly carried out the sentence and denouncing their son.<ref name="GOF30"/> She was a very [[Love|loving]] mother, as she swapped places with her son to allow him to escape prison while suffering in his place and desiring him to live out his new life for the better. According to Winky, Mrs Crouch would have wanted her son to enjoy some fresh air and freedom, not to be imprisoned by the [[Imperius Curse]].<ref name="GOF35"/> However, despite her love for her son, she had a poor judge of character, being oblivious or in denial to her son's true nature, with her act in rescuing him from Azkaban ultimately resulting in Voldemort's return and the downfalls of both both her son and husband.

==Relationships==
===Barty Crouch Snr===
{{Quote|He loved her as he had never loved me.|Barty Jnr describing his father's love for Mrs Crouch.|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:Roger Lloyd Pack as Barty Crouch Sr. (GoF-promo-02).jpg|152px|thumb|[[Bartemius Crouch Senior]], her husband]]
Mrs Crouch's husband, [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]], was very neglectful of his family life due to his devotion in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]'s eradication of the [[Dark Arts|Dark Forces]] such as the [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="GOF27"/> She was crushed when he dismissed their only son and sentenced him to Azkaban for life.<ref name="GOF30"/> However, they clearly loved each other deeply, no matter how the public views Mr Crouch's ruthlessness, as he agreed to his wife's dying wish to save their son in exchange for the last few weeks of her terminally-ill life. As Barty could not retrieve his wife's corpse without fearing exposure of the jailbreak, he had to stage her death and hold a quiet, private funeral for her with an empty grave. Barty would be persuaded to let his son attend the Quidditch World Cup when his wife's wishes were brought up by Winky, showing he still love her despite thirteen years have passed.<ref name="GOF35"/>

During his [[Insanity|delusive state]] from barely escaping [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] [[Imperius Curse]], Barty was muttering to a tree, talking as though his wife is still alive.<ref>{{GOF|B|28}}</ref>

===Barty Crouch Jnr===
{{Quote|She said my mother would have wanted it. She told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom. She had not saved me for a life of imprisonment.|Barty Jnr reiterating what Winky claimed Mrs Crouch would have wanted|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}Mrs Crouch loved her only son, [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]], very much. She was sobbing uncontrollably when he was convicted of a crime, and collapsed in shock and grief when her husband sentenced their child to life in prison.<ref name="GOF30"/> Mrs Crouch's love was what led to her health to deteriorate, and made her sacrifice her own life to rescue her son, while hoping that he would be able to live a second chance of freedom and a new leaf. She died bearing his appearance and name.<ref name="GOF35"/>

Originally, Barty Jnr seemed to have loved his mother in return, as he was crying for her help during his sentencing,<ref name="GOF30"/> and was screaming for her for the first week in his cell.<ref name="GOF35"/> However, as time passed, with the combination of the [[Dementor]]s' negative effects and his father's cruel and ruthless disinheriting, this caused Crouch Jnr to suffer a severe mental decline, changing him into an insane and psychopathic murderer who was fanatically loyal to Lord Voldemort, thus blinding him from those who truly loved him, namely his mother and the house-elf Winky. This renewed hatred led Barty to forget his mother and commit more crimes, such as patricide and reentering Voldemort's services, and then receiving the worse-than-[[death]] [[Dementor's Kiss]]. Conclusively, Mrs Crouch's love, sacrifices and good intentions were tragically wasted.
