'''Winky's mother''' was a [[house-elf]] that faithfully served the [[Crouch family]] her entire life, as her [[Winky's grandmother|mother before her]] did. After [[Winky]] was dismissed by her master, [[Bartemius Crouch Senior]], in [[August]] [[1994]], Winky despaired at what her mother would say if she knew.<ref name="GOF21">{{GOF|B|21}}</ref>
