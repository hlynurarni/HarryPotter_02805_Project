==Etymology==
Levski is a Bulgarian nickname-turned-surname of the freedom fighter Vasil Ivanov Kunchev, meaning "leonine" in reference to his athletic qualities and bravery. It is not used as a surname for other individuals.

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]], this character is known only by his surname. His first name is given as "Alexei" on a [[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game version]] of {{HBP}}.
*Alternatively, a spoof article by Sports Illustrated about the [[Quidditch World Cup]] gives his first name as Jakob.
*One of Bulgaria's most popular football teams is named after Vasil Levski, which creates additional allusions of Quidditch being the football counterpart of the wizarding community.
*"Levski" was the nickname of Vasil Ivanov Kunchev - a Bulgarian revolutionary renowned as the national hero of Bulgaria. Dubbed the ''Apostle of Freedom'', Levski ideologised and strategised a revolutionary movement toliberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule. He was sentenced to death and hanged in 1873.
*Levski is not a typical surname in Bulgaria.
