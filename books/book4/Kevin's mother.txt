The '''mother''' of [[Kevin]] went to the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] with her [[Kevin's father|husband]] and then two-year-old son, staying with them in a large, pyramid-shaped tent. Early in the morning, she came outside, and caught her young son using his father's [[wand]] to [[Engorgement Charm|enlarge]] a slug. She scolded him, then inadvertently stepped on the slug, causing it to burst. This upset Kevin, and he yelled at her, ''"You bust slug! You bust slug!"''<ref>{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Although it is never stated whether or not she was a [[Wizardkind|witch]], it can be assumed given that she went to the Quidditch World Cup when it was heavily protected with [[Muggle-Repelling Charm]]s. Also, she seemed to know about the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].
