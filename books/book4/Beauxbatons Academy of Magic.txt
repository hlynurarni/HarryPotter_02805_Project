'''Beauxbatons Academy of Magic''' (French: ''Académie de Magie Beauxbâtons'') was the [[France|French]] [[wizarding school]], located in the [[Pyrenees]] mountains<ref name="PM"/> of southern France. The school took many of its [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] students from France, as well as large numbers from [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Belgium]]. It is unknown if students from other countries were allowed.<ref name="PM" /> The school's coat of arms consisted of two golden wands crossed over one another, each shooting three stars.<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:BeauxbatonsCrest.png|thumb|Beauxbatons Coat of Arms]]
Founded sometime before the [[1290s]],<ref name="GOF">The [[Triwizard Tournament]] was founded "some seven-hundred years" before 1994, according to {{GOF|B|12}}, implying [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] and [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]] all existed by the 1290s.</ref> Beauxbatons had many noteworthy students over the years. Most prominent were [[Nicolas Flamel]], the [[alchemy|alchemist]] famed for discovering the [[Philosopher's Stone]], and his wife [[Perenelle Flamel|Perenelle]].<ref name="PM" />

Apart from the Flamels, famous ex-students of Beauxbatons included [[Vincent Duc de Trefle-Picques]], who escaped the [[Terror]] by casting a [[Concealment Charm]] on his own neck and pretending that his head had already been cut off; [[Luc Millefeuille]], the infamous pastry-maker and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]-[[poison]]er; and [[Fleur Delacour]], who fought in the world-famous [[Battle of Hogwarts]], married [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], and was awarded medals of bravery from both the [[French Ministry of Magic|French]] and [[British Ministry of Magic|British]] Ministries of Magic.<ref name="PM" /> [[Olympe Maxime]], [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] in the mid [[1990s]], was (in spite of her protestations to the contrary) a [[half-giant]]ess; clever, elegant, and undeniably awe-inspiring.<ref name="PM" />

Beauxbatons participated in the [[Triwizard Tournament]] that was held in [[1792]] and the tournament that was held in [[1994]]. During the 1792 tournament one of the tasks involved catching a [[cockatrice]]. However, the beast went on a rampage and injured three of the judges; one of the injured was at the time the [[Headteacher of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic during 1792|head of Beauxbatons]]. In the 1994 tournament, Fleur was selected school champion and finished in fourth place behind the other three contestants. During the 1994 tournament, Madame Maxime served as head of the academy.<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

==Castle and grounds==
{{main|Palace of Beauxbatons}}

[[File:Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.png|250px|thumb|left|[[Palace of Beauxbatons]]]]

The Palace of Beauxbatons was a beautiful chateau surrounded by majestic gardens and fountains [[magic]]ally created out of the surrounding mountains, and stood for over seven hundred years.<ref name="PM" /> In the [[Dining Chamber]], [[Wood Nymph]]s serenaded the students while they ate, and at [[Christmas]], the hall was adorned with great, glittering, non-melting ice sculptures.<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>

It was said that the stunning castle and grounds of this prestigious school were part-funded by alchemist gold, for Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel met at Beauxbatons in their youth, and a magnificent [[Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel Fountain|fountain]] in the middle of the school’s [[Beauxbatons park|park]], believed to have healing and beautifying properties, was named after them.<ref name="PM" />

==Traditions==
{{Quote|As the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powderblue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant.|The Beauxbatons' carriages arrive at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:Beauxbatons Carriage.png|250px|thumb|Beauxbatons's carriage]]
Students and staff were transported by use of the [[Beauxbatons Carriage]]s<ref>[[Wizarding World (website)|Pottermore]] - The Beauxbatons Carriage</ref> (French: ''Le carrosse de Beauxbâtons''). The carriages were light blue, pulled by a dozen [[Abraxan|winged horses]]. Despite being used as transportation by Beauxbatons, travelling in an Abraxan horse-drawn giant carriage the size of a house was a breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].<ref>[[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test]] - Grade 1, Question 11</ref> The Abraxan horses only drank single-malt [[whisky]].

The students at Beauxbatons Academy were taught to stand at attention from when their Headmistress entered the room until she sat herself, showing great respect for her.

At the Palace of Beauxbatons, they had ice sculptures all around the [[Dining Chamber]] at Christmas. The ice sculptures didn't melt, and were like statues of glittering diamond. According to [[Fleur Delacour]], the food that was served at the school was superb, with choirs of [[Wood Nymph]]s that serenaded students as they ate.<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>



===Uniform===

{{main|Beauxbatons uniform}}
The students wore pale blue robes made of fine silk.<ref name="GOF15" />

==Reputation and rivalry==
Education at Beauxbatons Academy was of a similar calibre to the education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[Scotland]]. Beauxbatons students took their equivalent of [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s in their [[sixth year]], rather than their [[fifth year|fifth]] like their Hogwarts counterparts.<ref>{{HBP|B|5}}</ref>

Typically, Beauxbatons Academy enjoyed a very warm, cordial relation with [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], as even during the [[Triwizard Tournament]] the two schools enjoyed a healthy rather than bitter rivalry; Beauxbatons won the Tournament sixty-two times and Hogwarts won sixty-three.<ref name="PM" />

In the last of these tournaments, from [[1994-1995 school year|1994-1995]], their relationship with Hogwarts was somewhat more strained, due to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|servant]] placing [[Harry Potter]]'s name in the [[Goblet of Fire]] thereby giving Hogwarts a second champion, though the relationship did not become outright hostile (as individual Hogwarts and Beauxbatons students remained friendly towards one another and some even attended the [[Yule Ball]] with one another). In addition, Madam Maxime returned to Hogwarts for [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s funeral, demonstrating that the cordial relationship continued between the schools.<ref>{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Beauxbatons was likely devised from the French "beaux bâtons," literally translated as "beautiful sticks". In French, "baguette" is the word used for "wand" but "bâton" might be a reference to it, although it would be more likely translated as "staff" (e.g. Mad-Eye Moody's staff).

==Behind the scenes==
*Some Beauxbatons students and Madame Maxime attended the final of the Quidditch World Cup in England in 1994. It's unknown if Beauxbatons, like Hogwarts, has summer holidays in August and, if they have, if there is a regular option to stay at Beauxbatons during the summer or if this was a special arrangement for the Quidditch World Cup only.
*In the book, it's suggested both the male and female students of the school are good-looking.
*In the movie, the Beauxbatons Coat of Arms is a shield surrounded by golden lines with two gold wands on the top; in the book it is two crossed wands emitting three stars each in the middle.
*In the UK and US audiobook editions of {{GOF}}, the pronunciation of "Beauxbatons" sounds more French, as both [[Stephen Fry]] and [[Jim Dale]] respectively not having pronounced the S at the end of the name. {{PM}} confirms Fry's pronouncation, styling it as Bo - batton.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Beauxbatons is incorrectly pronounced by Dumbledore as boh-BAT-tons. This appears to be an error of pronunciation on Dumbledore's behalf, seeing as the French students pronounce it correctly.
[[File:Butterfly_conjuring_spell.gif|frame|The entrance of the all female students into the Great Hall in {{GOF|F}}]]
*In {{GOF|FA}}, Beauxbatons is pictured as an all-girls school; which is directly contrasted in the novel. At least four boys are in attendance in the book and Davet Dumont, Nicholas Flamel, Luc Millefeuille and Vincent Duc de Trefle-Picques were students in earlier decades, showing it is a co-educational establishment. It was likely intended as a contrast to the students of Durmstrang, who, in the film, are all male.
*In {{GOF|FA}}, it is said that [[Gabrielle Delacour]] is already a Beauxbatons student; the book does not explicitly identify her as such, though she does come to Hogwarts with the other Beauxbatons students. As {{DH}} reveals Gabrielle to be eleven by that point (marking her as eight at the beginning of ''Goblet of Fire''), this suggests that Beauxbatons students start school at a much earlier age than Hogwarts ones.
*The students of Beauxbatons likely buy their material like books and wands on [[Place Cachée]]
