{{Quote|Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman's not helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security! Blimey, I'll be glad when this is over. See you later, Arthur.|The [[Obliviator]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' worked in the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as an [[Obliviator]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="GOF7"/>

==History==
In [[1994]] he was stationed at [[Roberts|Mr Roberts]]' [[Quidditch World Cup Campsite|campsite]]. He is described as wearing plus fours, and he looked extremely exhausted, as there were purple shadows under his eyes and his chin was blue with stubble. He used a [[Memory Charm]] on Roberts when he questioned incessantly about the [[wizarding world]] such as [[Unidentified man who tried to pay Mr Roberts with Galleons|a man]] that tried to pay him with [[Galleon|big gold coins]] or [[Archie Aymslowe|a "weirdo" wearing a dress]]. He told [[Arthur Weasley]] that the [[Charm]] had to be used ten times a day to keep Roberts from realising the [[Wizardkind|true nature]] of the "foreigners" in his campsite.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most accomplished adult wizards, he was capable of apparating at will.<ref name="GOF7"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Being an [[Obliviator]], he was highly proficient with the casting of the [[Memory Charm]].<ref name="GOF7"/>
