{{Dialogue a-b|Unidentified wizard #1|I pull down about a hundred sacks of [[Galleon]]s a year! "I'm a [[dragon killer]] for the [[Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures]].|[[Wizard who claimed to be a Vampire Hunter|Unidentified wizard #2]]|No, you're not! You're a dishwasher at the [[Leaky Cauldron]]… but I'm a [[Vampire Hunter]], I've killed about ninety so far -|A group of wizards fighting over the affections of a group of Veela|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended the [[1994]] [[Quidditch World Cup]] between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Ireland]]. He claimed that he was a [[dragon killer]] in an attempt to impress a group of [[Veela]], but [[Wizard who claimed to be a Vampire Hunter|his friend]] stated that he was actually a dishwasher at the [[Leaky Cauldron]].<ref name="GOF9">{{GOF|B|9}}</ref> It is extremely unlikely that the "dragon killer"'s claim was true.
