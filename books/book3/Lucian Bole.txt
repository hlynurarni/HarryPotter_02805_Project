[[1977]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Slytherin]] student who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] from [[1988]] to [[1995]].<ref name="ootp19">In Ch. 19 of ''Order of the Phoenix'', Angelina Johnson states, "Last year's Beaters, Derrick and Bole, have left."

==Biography==
Lucian Bole started his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in [[1988]], he was sorted into the house of [[Slytherin]] and became a member of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], playing the role of beater.

During the final match between [[Gryffindor]] and Slytherin in his sixth year, Bole clubbed Gryffindor [[Chaser]] [[Alicia Spinnet]], claiming he had mistaken her for a [[Bludger]]. In revenge, [[George Weasley]] elbowed Bole in the face, leading [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] to give both teams penalties.

In Bole's seventh year, the [[Triwizard Tournament]] lead all [[Quidditch]] games at Hogwarts to be cancelled, but he nonetheless nominally retained his position on the Slytherin team until his graduation in June 1995.<ref name="ootp19" /> He and fellow Slytherin Beater, [[Peregrine Derrick]], were replaced by [[Vincent Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] at the beginning of the next Quidditch season. [[Angelina Johnson]], the new captain of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], was glad to see Bole and Derrick gone, stating mockingly that she was always stunned the pair were able to find their way to Quidditch pitch without directions.
