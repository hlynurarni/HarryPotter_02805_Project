A '''security troll''' was a specially-trained [[troll]] who guarded certain places and objects in [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] society.<ref name="POA14">{{POA|B|14}}</ref> Some [[wizardkind|wizards and witches]] made their living out of training security trolls.<ref name="OOTP29">{{OOTP|B|29}}</ref>

==History==
===1993-1994===
In [[1993]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] hired security trolls to guard the [[Fat Lady]]'s [[portrait]] after [[Sirius Black]] attacked her in an attempt to get into [[Gryffindor Tower]] and [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] was fired for letting him in while he was covering for the Fat Lady. These Trolls were placed in the [[North Wing]] and were evidently a different type of Troll than the [[Mountain troll|mountain]] variety, since they seemed considerably more intelligent and less smelly. They spent all their time pacing the corridor in front of the Fat Lady's portrait, giving dirty looks to everyone who happened by and comparing the sizes of their clubs.<ref name="POA14"/> They left at the end of the year, when Sirius led the Ministry into knowing that he fled out of the country.

===1996===
In [[1996]], [[Dolores Umbridge]] apparently hired an armed security troll to guard [[Harry Potter]]'s [[Harry Potter's Firebolt|Firebolt]].<ref name="OOTP30">{{OOTP|B|30}}</ref> This was after [[Fred and George Weasley]] made their final departure from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and had stolen their brooms back, Umbridge decided that it would be best to move Harry's broom to the [[Dungeons]] with the added security measure of security trolls.<ref name="OOTP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref> It was eventually dismissed when Umbridge left, and Harry got his Firebolt back.

Security trolls were employed at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], helping to inspect lifts and carts.<ref name="WWHP">{{WWHP}} - [[Harry Potter and the Escape From Gringotts]] ride</ref>

In the [[21st century]], security trolls were unleashed as a [[Confoundable]] by the [[Calamity]] and had to be dealt with by the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>
