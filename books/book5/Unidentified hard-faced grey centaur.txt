{{Quote|We are not all like the traitor [[Firenze]], [[human]] [[Hermione Granger|girl]]|Unidentified hard-faced [[centaur]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

This '''centaur''' lived in the [[Forbidden Forest Centaur colony]].<ref name="OOTP30"/><ref name="OOTP33"/>

==Biography==
by the [[1995-1996 school year]]. He resented the [[centaur]] [[Firenze]] going to work for [[Albus Dumbledore]], and considered it going "into servitude to [[human]]s." After [[Rubeus Hagrid]] saved Firenze, this centaur with the other centaurs kicked both Firenze and Hagrid out, and resented Hagrid's [[giant]] half-brother [[Grawp]].<ref name="OOTP30">{{OOTP|B|30}}</ref>

{{Dialogue a-b|Centaur|What are you doing in our forest? Why are you here?|Umbridge|'Your' forest? I would remind you that you live here only because the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] permits you certain areas of land-|hard-faced centaur and [[Dolores Umbridge]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

Later that year, the centaur with his allies attacked [[Dolores Umbridge]], when she entered their area of the forest, and took Umbridge when she called centaurs "of near-human intelligence." After ridding themselves of Umbridge, this centaur and [[Unidentified centaur|another]] tried to decide what to do with [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] who had insulted them, despite the latter's protests. Fortunately, this centaur and the others were scared off by [[Grawp]].<ref name="OOTP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref>
