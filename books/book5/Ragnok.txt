==Biography==
[[File:Ragnok'sOffice.png|250px|thumb|Ragnok's office at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]]]
Ragnok worked at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in the 1990's , and had an office next to [[Griphook]] in the main offices at [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="WWoHP"/> Ragnok was acquainted with [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], and seemingly known to [[Remus Lupin|Professor Remus Lupin]] as well.

It seems that Ragnok's leanings were such that Professor Lupin thought he might be amenable to helping the [[Order of the Phoenix]], though when Bill tried to convince him to do so in [[1995]], Ragnok declined, as he was feeling a lot of hostility toward [[Wizardkind|wizards]] at the time. [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] had recently failed to pay some goblins winnings to which they felt they were entitled, and Ragnok believed that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] had conspired to hide evidence of this. He expressed his thoughts on the matter very vehemently.<ref name="OP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref>
