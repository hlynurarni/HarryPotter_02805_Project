==Biography==
In [[1995]], she tried out for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], but was denied the position of [[Keeper]] because she admitted she would put the [[Charms Club]], to which she belonged, before [[Quidditch]]. Being unable to attend some practises was the reason [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] was picked, despite the fact that Vicky played better. According to Angelina, Vicky was also involved in other Hogwarts clubs and societies, besides Charms.<ref name="OOTP13">{{OOTP|B|13}}</ref>
