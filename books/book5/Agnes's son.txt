{{Quote|Here you are, Agnes. See, not forgotten, are you? And your son's sent an owl saying he's visiting tonight, so that's nice, isn't it?|Healer [[Miriam Strout]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

An '''unknown individual''' was the son of [[Agnes]], a patient in the long-term [[Janus Thickey Ward]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. He intended to visit her over [[Christmas]] in [[1995]]. When the [[Healer]] told Agnes of the owl he had sent informing them that he would be coming, her only reply was to give several loud barks.<ref>{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>
