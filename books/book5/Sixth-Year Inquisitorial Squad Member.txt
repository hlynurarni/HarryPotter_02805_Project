This '''[[sixth year]] girl''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Slytherin]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1990s]].

==Biography==
===1995–1996 school year===
[[File:Inquisitorial Squad.jpg|thumb|left|Dolores Umbridge inducting her, Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and several other students into the Inquisitorial Squad]]
She was in her [[sixth year]] in the [[1995–1996 school year]]. During that year, she became a member of the short-lived [[Inquisitorial Squad]], an organisation created that year by the newly appointed [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Professor]] and [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Her involvement in the discovery of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in [[1996]] is unknown, although along with all the other squad members, she would have used her power abusively to discriminate against other non-Slytherin students.

In [[June]] 1996, when [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ginevra Weasley]], [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Luna Lovegood]] tried to use the fireplace in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher's office|Umbridge's office]] to communicate with [[Sirius Black]] via the [[Floo Network]], Umbridge and several squad members, including herself, caught them. She managed to restrain Ginny by grabbing hold of her and holding both her arms in a tight-grip.<ref name="OOTP32">{{OOTP|B|32}}</ref> However, she and the squad failed to keep the Dumbledore's Army members restrained for very long, as once Umbridge had left with Harry and Hermione to the [[Forbidden Forest]], all the present squad members were attacked with various nasty [[jinx]]es, [[hex]]es and [[curse]]s by Ginny, Neville and Luna in revenge, such as with Ginny's particularly powerful [[Bat-Bogey Hex]]. She was presumably incapacitated during the incident.<ref name="OOTP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref>

===Post-Inquisitorial Squad===
The [[Inquisitorial Squad]] was disbanded following the suspension and departure of Umbridge from Hogwarts, following the [[British Ministry of Magic]]'s long awaited (but still reluctant) acceptance that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had indeed [[Return of Lord Voldemort|returned]]. Her activities after the disbandment are unknown.
