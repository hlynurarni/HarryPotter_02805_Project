==Etymology==
*"Barnabas" is a Greek form of an Aramaic name. In Acts in the New Testament the byname Barnabas was given to a man named Joseph, a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys. The original Aramaic is unattested, but it may be from בּר נביא (bar naviya') meaning "son of the prophet", though in Acts 4:36 it is claimed that the name means "son of encouragement". As an English name, it came into occasional use after the 12th century.
*According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the word "barmy" is an informal adjective, chiefly used in Britain that means mad, crazy or extremely foolish.

==Behind the scenes==
*Actor [[Mason Kayne]] was considered for the role of Barnabas the Barmy to in the tapestry outside the Room of Requirement in the film, but the scenes were never filmed and the tapestry is not present in the corridor.
