{{Quote|"Right," said [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]], beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy. Its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress. "Everybody ready?" They nodded, clustering around her. [[Alastor Moody|Moody]] gave [[Harry Potter|Harry]] another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy, her breath steaming up the glass. "Wotcher… [[Weasley family|We]]'re here to see [[Arthur Weasley]]."|Harry and the Weasleys visit St Mungo's.|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
