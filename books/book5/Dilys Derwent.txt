'''Professor Dilys Derwent''' (d. [[1768]]<ref name="OP22"/>) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked as a [[Healer]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] and was a celebrated [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Her [[portrait]] hangs not only in the [[Headmaster's office|Headmaster's Office]] along with the [[Headmaster portraits|portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses]], but also in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]' main admitting area.<ref name="OP22" />

==Biography==
===As a Healer and Headmistress===
Derwent started working at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] in [[1722]].

Derwent left the job in [[1741]] and became the [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] that same year. She proved very popular among students and teachers, gaining her the status of one of the "most celebrated [[Headmaster|Heads]]" among Dumbledore and Everard. She died in the post in 1768.<ref name="OP22" />

===Post-mortem===
When [[Arthur Weasley]] was attacked by Voldemort's snake [[Nagini]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]] in late [[1995]], [[Albus Dumbledore]], then-[[Headmaster]], asked Derwent to go to her portrait at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]'s main admitting area in order to keep Dumbledore apprised on Mr Weasley's condition.<ref name="OP22" />

When [[Harry Potter]] went to the [[Headmaster's office]], shortly after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s defeat and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Dilys Derwent joined the ovation made by the previous Hogwarts Headmasters, sobbing unashamedly.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Dilys" means "genuine" in Welsh. Derwent may be from the name of an English lake in Cumbria, in the Lake District called "Derwent Water".
