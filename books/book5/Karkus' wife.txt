'''Karkus's wife''' was a [[giant]]ess who lived in the last remaining [[Giant colony|colony of giants]] in [[Europe]]. As of [[1995]], [[Karkus|her husband]] was the [[Gurg]] of the colony, who regularly demanded the other giants to bring food for the two of them. However, that year Karkus was killed by [[Golgomath]], who took over the position as Gurg.<ref>{{OOTP|B|20}}</ref>
