{{Quote| ''[...]'' and Araminta Meliflua... cousin of my mother's... tried to force through a [[Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal]] ''[...]''|[[Sirius Black]] to [[Harry Potter]] on Araminta|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

'''Araminta Meliflua Black'''<ref name="scholastic">Wizard's Challenge at the [http://harrypotter.scholastic.com/ Scholastic Official Site]</ref> was [[Walburga Black]]’s cousin, and [[Sirius Black]]’s first or second cousin once removed. She was noted for her hatred of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s. She once tried to get the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to pass a law that would make Muggle-hunting legal. The bill was most likely turned down.

==Etymology==
*[http://www.behindthename.com/name/araminta Araminta] is a name of uncertain origin. It may be an elaborated form of [http://www.behindthename.com/name/aminta Aminta], which derives from the Greek word ''amyntor'', meaning "defender." Araminta Ross was the birth name of African-American abolitionist [[Wikipedia:Harriet Tubman|Harriet Tubman]].
*''Meliflua'' is presumably based on the English adjective "[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=mellifluous mellifluous]," which means "sweet-sounding" and derives from the Latin ''mellifluus'', "flowing like honey".

==Behind the scenes==
*Although [[Sirius Black]] pointed out Araminta to his godson, [[Harry Potter]], on the [[House of Black|Black family tapestry]], her name did not appear on the copy of the family tree [[J. K. Rowling]] donated to a charity auction in [[2006]]. It's unknown why this is, though the Black Family Tree contains other errors.
*Araminta's exact relationship to Walburga is unknown, but there are several clues: [[Scholastic]] gives Araminta the surname ''Black'', she is depicted on the Black family tree in the books but not on the one auctioned for charity, and she must be more closely related to Walburga than to Walburga's second cousin and husband [[Orion Black|Orion]] for their son to remember her as Walburga's cousin alone. This leaves several possibilities:
**Araminta is descended from Walburga's grandfather [[Cygnus Black II|Cygnus Black]]. Walburga is the daughter of his eldest son [[Pollux Black|Pollux]], who had three younger siblings: [[Cassiopeia Black|Cassiopeia]], who never married, [[Marius Black|Marius]], who was disowned for being a [[Squib]], and [[Dorea Black|Dorea]] married [[Charlus Potter]] and had [[Charlus Potter's son|one son]]. It is unlikely that a Squib's child would promote muggle-hunting or be acknowledged by the Black family, so Araminta might be an illegitimate child of Cassiopeia or Dorea. In this case, she would have been left off the auctioned family tree to avoid the scandal of illegitimacy.
**Araminta and Walburga are cousins through Walburga's mother [[Irma Crabbe]] or her grandmother [[Violetta Bulstrode]]. Both Crabbes/Bulstrodes married members of the House of Black and had children, but Araminta's branch of the Black family is not descended from [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] and therefore do not appear on the segment of the family tree auctioned for charity, which only showed his descendants.
**Araminta and Walburga are cousins through Walburga's mother Irma Crabbe or her grandmother Violetta Bulstrode, and Araminta married into a branch of the Black family that is not descended from Phineas Nigellus and therefore do not appear on the auctioned segment of the Black family tree.
