'''[[Madam]] Chang''' (b. [[7 September]])<ref name="born"/> was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]],<ref name="OOTPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref> employee of the [[British Ministry of Magic]], and the mother of [[Cho Chang]].

==Biography==
[[File:Katie Leung as Cho Chang (GoF-promo-06).jpg|202x202px|thumb|left|Madam Chang's daughter Cho]]
Her birthday was [[7 September]].<ref name="born"/> Cho remembered this fact at the last minute in [[1995]] and rushed to the [[Owlery]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to send her mother a gift.<ref name="OOTP14">{{OOTP|B|14}}</ref>

Madam Chang (like her [[Cho Chang's father|husband]]) wanted her daughter to not get on [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s bad side in her [[sixth year]]. However, Cho went against their wishes and joined [[Dumbledore's Army]].<ref name="OOTP18">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref> Umbridge later threatened to fire Madam Chang because of her daughter's involvement in the DA.<ref name="OOTPF"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, [[Hermione Granger]] mentions that [[Dolores Umbridge]] is threatening to fire [[Cho Chang|Cho's]] mother from her job at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], presumably because of Cho's involvement in [[Dumbledore's Army]]. This addition to the plot was likely made because [[Marietta Edgecombe]] and her [[Marietta Edgecombe's mother|mother]], a known Ministry employee, were cut from the script.
