The '''Hogwarts Thestral herd''' was a herd of [[Thestral]]s employed at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. 

==History==
They lived in the [[Forbidden Forest]], specifically in the [[Thestral Paddock]]. The herd started out with one male and five females, with [[Tenebrus]] as the first to be bred in the forest. The [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds|Gamekeeper]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]] bred, trained, and cared for the creatures. They were mainly used to pull the [[Hogwarts Carriages|Hogwarts carriages]] up to the school from [[Hogsmeade station|Hogsmeade Station]] to the [[Entrance Gates]] for Second through Seventh year students,<ref name="OOTP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref><ref name="HBP8">{{HBP|B|8}}</ref> although they were sometimes used by [[Albus Dumbledore]] when he went on a long journey and didn't want to [[Apparition|Apparate]]. 

These Thestrals were trained to go to anywhere they are told by a rider due to their impeccable sense of direction. They were also trained not to attack [[owl]]s so as not to interfere with the [[Owl Postal Service|owl post]].<ref name="OOTP17">{{OOTP|B|17}}</ref> Hagrid reckoned that the herd was the only tamed herd of its size in [[Great Britain]].

Hagrid used this herd of Thestrals to teach his [[fifth year]] [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class about these creatures. Several students, including [[Parvati Patil]] and [[Lavender Brown]] were frightened by viewing the Thestrals eating a carcass on the floor, as they were [[Invisibility|invisible]] to most eyes.<ref name="OOTP21">{{OOTP|B|21}}</ref>

The herd also took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where they attacked the [[Death Eaters]] and [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[giant]] allies.<ref name=DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

*[[Tenebrus]] - First born in the forest and Hagrid's personal favourite.
