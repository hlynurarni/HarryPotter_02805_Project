These two '''[[gargoyle]]s''' stood in the [[Staffroom passage|staffroom corridor]], protecting the [[staffroom]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="OOTP17"/>

==History==
In [[1995]], [[Harry Potter]] tried to get into the staffroom to see [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] after his [[owl]] [[Hedwig]] was injured. They were less than sympathetic to his pleading.<ref name="OOTP17">{{OOTP|B|17}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]], both gargoyles were smashed apart by a stray [[jinx]] that had sailed through a broken window. As [[Harry Potter|Harry]] rushed past them, one of the broken gargoyle's heads remarked ''"Oh, don't mind me... I'll just lie here and crumble..."''<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>
