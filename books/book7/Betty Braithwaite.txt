'''Betty Braithwaite''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked as a reporter for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name="DH2"/>

In [[1997]], she got an exclusive interview with [[Rita Skeeter]] about her then-upcoming book, ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]''. She was invited into [[Rita Skeeter's home|Rita's home]], where Rita served her [[tea]] and a slice of [[pound cake]].<ref name="DH2">{{DH|B|2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Braithwaite apparently took a liking to Rita Skeeter, or at least pretended to, as her article gave the impression of Skeeter being a sweet, kind woman, despite her cruel and libellous writings. However, this could have been due to an entirely understandable desire not to get on the wrong side of someone with such a poison pen, and a clear capacity to carry a grudge.
