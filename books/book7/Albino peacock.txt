An '''albino peacock''' is a male peafowl, distinctive for its pure white colour due to total or partial lack of [[Wikipedia:Biological pigment|biochromes]]. 

==History==
[[Lucius Malfoy]] kept at least one on the grounds of [[Malfoy Manor]].<ref name="dh1">{{DH|B|1}}</ref><ref>{{DH|B|23}}</ref> It was on top of the hedge when [[Severus Snape]] and [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] arrived at the Manor for a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] meeting in July [[1997]]. It rustled the bushes as it strutted, alarming Yaxley, who drew his [[Yaxley's wand|wand]], but put it away once he saw the noise's source.<ref name="dh1" />

==Behind the scenes==
*Several colour varieties of [[Wikipedia:Peafowl|peafowl]] have been bred, including white.<ref name="peafowlvarieties">"[http://database.amyspeacockparadise.com/white.shtml White Peafowl]" on the Peafowl Varieties Database</ref> This differs from [[Wikipedia:Albinism|albinism]], which would cause lack of pigmentation not just in the feathers, but in the skin and eyes as well.<ref name="peafowlvarieties" /><ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism Albinism]" on Wikipedia</ref> However, in Chapter 23 of {{DH}}, the peacock at Malfoy Manor is explicitly referred to as "albino".
*Many have argued that this peacock was, in fact, [[Lucius Malfoy]]'s [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]. It was thought that this proved Lucius was, in point of fact, not a true [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], as Death Eaters cannot produce Patronuses. Despite this, [[J. K. Rowling]] confirmed in an interview that this was merely an albino peacock.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, [[Lucius Malfoy]] can control a pet peacock, although it is blue in colour.
