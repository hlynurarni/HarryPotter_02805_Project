The '''mother''' of [[Muriel]] was a [[pure-blood|pure]] or [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]]<ref name="blood">It is mentioned that Molly is pure-blood, so that her family has to be. However, it is unknown if this woman is Molly's great-grandmother; Muriel may have married a great-uncle of Molly's. If this is the case, then Muriel's mother is no blood relation of Molly or her family.</ref> and also close friends with [[Bathilda Bagshot]]. During a conversation with Bathilda, she learned of the altercation between brothers [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] and [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], which had occurred at their sister Ariana's funeral. Unknown to her, [[Muriel]] was listening to the discussion from behind the door.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Muriel is Molly's great-aunt. If Muriel was the grandmother of Mr or Mrs Prewett, this woman is Molly's great-grandmother and the Weasley children's great-great-grandmother.<ref name="PM" />
