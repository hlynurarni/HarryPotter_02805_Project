'''Magical Maintenance''' was a division of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Members of this Department were the custodians of the Ministry. They were responsible for maintaining the upkeep of the Ministry, including deciding what weather to display through the Ministry's [[enchanted window]]s and repairing [[magic]] gone wrong within the premises of the Ministry, such as [[Water|rain]] inside an office.<ref name="OOTP7">{{OOTP|B|7}}</ref>

Magical Maintenance was presumably in charge of maintaining the lifts and ensuring that the [[Atrium]] fireplaces were supplied with [[Floo Powder]], in addition to less magical forms of maintenance such as tidying up.<ref name="OOTP7">{{OOTP|B|27}}</ref> The personnel working in the Magical Maintenance Department wore navy blue robes.<ref name="DH12"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*While {{DH}} specifies that Magical Maintenance personnel wears navy blue robes, the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|film adaptation]] shows them wearing a thin overcoat of greyish-purple colour.
*Employees of this department seems to be the lowest ranking in the social ladder, as [[Dolores Umbridge]] was ashamed of her father [[Orford Umbridge|Orford]] for being a member of this sector, mostly mopping floors within the Ministry. The pay also seems rather low, as Orford accepted a ''small'' monthly allowance from Dolores in exchange for an early retirement over staying with the paying job.
