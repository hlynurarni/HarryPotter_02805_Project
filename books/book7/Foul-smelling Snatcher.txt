===As a Snatcher===
{{Quote|Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. Then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn't do it so well. Splinched myself again and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we'd been… you were gone.|[[Ronald Weasley]] tells [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] of his encounter with [[Snatchers]].|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}In [[December]], [[1997]], this Snatcher's gang caught [[Ronald Weasley]], who had abandoned [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] during their [[Horcrux hunt|quest to destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes]]. After telling them he was [[Stanley Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]], Ron managed to distract them enough so that he took back [[Ronald Weasley's wand|his wand]], as well as this [[Blackthorn wand|individual's]] and [[Apparition|Disapparated]] from the place.<ref name="DH19"/>
