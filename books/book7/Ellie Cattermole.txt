'''Ellie Cattermole''' (fl. 1997) was the daughter of [[Mary Cattermole|Mary]] and [[Reginald Cattermole]]. She had a brother, [[Alfred Cattermole|Alfred]], and a sister, [[Maisie Cattermole|Maisie]]. She lived at [[27 Chislehurst Gardens|27]] [[Chislehurst Gardens]], [[Great Tolling]], [[Evesham]] with her parents, brother and sister.<ref>{{DH|B|13}}</ref>

Mary Cattermole said that Ellie and her siblings were frightened during her interrogation by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. They believed that their mother would not return home.

Her mother told the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] that Ellie and her brother and sister were at home. They were probably not attending Hogwarts yet, because Harry Potter told her and her husband to pick up the children and run away.
