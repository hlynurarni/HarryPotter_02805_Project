A '''band''' wearing golden jackets played music at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] at [[the Burrow]] on [[1 August]], [[1997]].

==History==
Before the ceremony began, they smoked pipes under a tree near the tent with the [[Waiters at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding|waiters]]. Once the reception started, the band moved to the podium, and played music for the guests to dance to.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref> After everyone at the wedding was informed of the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|Fall]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic]] by the [[Lynx]] [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] of [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], they presumably fled the Wedding following the [[Attack at the Burrow|arrival]] of [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="DH9">{{DH|B|9}}</ref>
