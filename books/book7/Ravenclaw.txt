{{Quote|Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,<br/>If you've a ready mind,<br/>Where those of wit and learning,<br/>Will always find their kind.|The [[Sorting Hat]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

'''Ravenclaw''' is one of the four [[Hogwarts Houses|Houses]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Its founder was the medieval witch [[Rowena Ravenclaw]].<ref name="COS9"/> Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol is an [[eagle]], and blue and bronze are its colours.<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> The Head of Ravenclaw is [[Filius Flitwick]],<ref name="PM-ravenclaw"/><ref name="HBP29"/> and the house [[ghost]] is the [[Helena Ravenclaw|Grey Lady]],<ref name="PS7"/> otherwise known as the daughter of [[Rowena Ravenclaw]], [[Helena Ravenclaw]].<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of [[Wikipedia:Air (classical element)|air]]<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling]</ref>, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air.<ref name="PM">{{WW|colours}}</ref> The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue [[sapphire]]s.<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

{{Quote|Wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure.|Rowena Ravenclaw|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:PR 007 007-e1313269741697.jpg|241x241px|thumb|left|[[Rowena Ravenclaw]], the founder of Ravenclaw]]

Ravenclaw House prizes learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members.<ref name="PS7" /> Thus, many Ravenclaws tend to be academically motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods. It is not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other houses might shun.<ref name="PM-ravenclaw"/> [[Hermione Granger]], an extremely intelligent witch and the top student in her year, was sorted into [[Gryffindor]], though she admitted that the [[Sorting Hat]] had seriously considered placing her in Ravenclaw.<ref name="OOTP16">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref>

Often hard-working and diligent, as often is the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities. [[Luna Lovegood]], for example, was one such student: Eccentric to put it at its mildest, she was a Ravenclaw student who initially was bullied for her open defiance of conventionality, but ultimately became a celebrated [[Magizoologist|wizarding naturalist]] and renowned for her participation in the legendary [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and past membership in [[Dumbledore's Army]]. Another example would be Professor [[Filius Flitwick]], a half-goblin who might have faced scorn for his short stature earlier in life but went on to become a renowned [[Supreme Dueller|Duelling Champion]], and subsequently one of the finest and most knowledgable [[Charms Master]]s in the entirety of the wizarding world during his employment at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. (''The'' best, according to some of his students).

Ravenclaws tend to be curious about the world and pay attention to the world around them. Ravenclaws are known to be logical and rational. In addition, Ravenclaw students tend to have abilities regarding Memory. [[Garrick Ollivander]], for example, possessed an eidetic memory and can remember every wand he has sold,<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref> and [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] had an exceptional talent in the [[Memory Charm]].<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>

Even so, not all Ravenclaws were motivated by academic prowess. Examples of such individuals included [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] and [[Cho Chang]], both of whom sought to use the good name and renown of their house, the inherent expectations of certain academic prowess that comes with being sorted into it as well as the often somewhat natural ability of its members to gain popularity among their peers, which particularly was the case of the former, proving true the fact that a good student did not necessarily make a good witch or wizard.

[[Minerva McGonagall]] was a [[Hatstall]], having approximately equal Ravenclaw and Gryffindor traits; the [[Sorting Hat]] finally Sorted her into Gryffindor.<ref name="hatstall"/> [[Hermione Granger]] was also considered for Ravenclaw due to her intelligence, but the hat ultimately decided on Gryffindor once again.<ref name="OOTP19">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref> [[Filius Flitwick]] was in the same situation at the time of his Sorting, but in his case the Hat decided on Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor.<ref name="hatstall">{{WW|hatstall}}</ref>

{{Quote|I got into big trouble during my third year for duelling a Ravenclaw prefect who insisted that Bridget Wenlock had come from his house, not mine.|A Hufflepuff with an intelligent witch in their house|Pottermore}}[[File:Eagle.jpg|178x178px|thumb|Ravenclaw's symbol]]

According to [[Slytherin]] [[prefect]] [[Gemma Farley]], Ravenclaws are so competitive when it comes to academic success that they are known to backstab each other, and likely other students, in order to get top marks. While [[Hufflepuff]] prefect [[Gabriel Truman]] noted that they are so proud of the success of famous members, such as [[Laverne de Montmorency]], that they claim any intelligent wizard as a member of Ravenclaw House, such as [[Bridget Wenlock]], who was, in fact, a Hufflepuff. Some Ravenclaws, such as [[Uric the Oddball]], [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], and his daughter [[Luna Lovegood]] are also noted to have a propensity towards eccentricity.

[[File:Grey Lady1.png|234x234px|thumb|left|House ghost, The Grey Lady]]

Ravenclaw House appears to have little rivalry with the other houses, except in [[Quidditch]]. [[Harry Potter]] believed that they tended to side with [[Gryffindor]] in its rivalry with Slytherin, as did Hufflepuff house.<ref name="PS15">{{PS|B|15}}</ref><ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref> However, during the [[1994]] [[Triwizard Tournament]], most Ravenclaws supported Hufflepuff Champion [[Cedric Diggory]] over Harry. They believed that Harry had, in fact, cheated his way into being a champion and that the true Hogwarts champion was Cedric.<ref name="GOF18">{{GOF|B|18}}</ref> Many Ravenclaws (such as [[Cho Chang]]) joined [[Dumbledore's Army]] and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] along with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs. They rose at almost the exact moment as the Hufflepuffs and turned their wands upon [[Pansy Parkinson]] and Slytherin House in Harry Potter's defence when the former wished to hand Harry over to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his army of [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

Within the house, though, they’re well-known for being welcoming and encouraging of creativity, eccentricity, and individuality and being very accepting.

==Common Room==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Knocker|Which came first, the [[phoenix]] or the flame?|Luna Lovegood|I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.|Well reasoned.|[[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] solving a riddle to enter Ravenclaw tower|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Ravenclaw common room.png|215x215px|thumb|Ravenclaw common room]]

The Ravenclaw common room is in one of the castle's towers and is wide and circular. You have to climb a [[Ravenclaw Tower Staircase|tight spiral staircase]] to get there. It has graceful arched windows, and the walls are hung with blue and bronze silks. The domed ceiling is painted with stars, which are echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. Tables, chairs, and bookcases cover the expanse of the floor, and a white marble statue of [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] sits next to the door that leads to the dormitories above. Harry Potter entered the common room in 1998 while searching for clues to the location of one of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s Horcruxes.<ref name="DH29">{{DH|B|29}}</ref>

Unlike the other common rooms in the school, a logical riddle given by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker must be answered to enter.<ref name="DH29"/> This could prove troublesome as anyone with enough intellect could intrude into the dormitory, as is shown in [[1998]] where [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] had no trouble entering by answering the riddle correctly<ref name="DH30">{{DH|B|30}}</ref> (though she was a "[[hatstall]]" between [[Gryffindor]] and Ravenclaw).<ref name="hatstall">{{WW|hatstall}}</ref> On the other hand, a particularly poorly-phrased riddle might bemuse a particular student, blocking them from entering and forcing them to sleep outside. However, [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] stated in her first year when figuring out the complicated riddle, beneath the trapdoor, that most wizards and witches do not have much sense of logic,<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref> which might be something that Ravenclaw noticed herself and decided to use clever riddles instead of passwords, as they are safer than some words.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:House_Cup.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[Great Hall]] with the Ravenclaw banners raised]]
*In the books, Ravenclaw colours are blue and bronze; however, in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]] they were changed to blue and silver. Likewise, Ravenclaw's symbol is an eagle in the books and a raven in the films, though in the last film, an eagle does appear as the Ravenclaw mascot.
*Eagles are a symbol for a broader vision and strength of mind and heart.
*[[Basil Fronsac]] was likely a Ravenclaw.
*[[Gilderoy Lockhart]] was a Ravenclaw. This can be seen on his [[Quidditch]] robes from a picture of his past while at Hogwarts, and was later confirmed by [[J. K. Rowling]] on {{PM}}.[[File:Screenshot 883.png|thumb]]
*The Ravenclaw Common Room does not appear in {{DH|F2}}, but it is still possible to glimpse the stairwell inside the Tower. The Common Room's door can also be glimpsed. This is the same for {{LEGO|Y2}}.
*Ravenclaw is the only House from which no [[Head Boy or Girl]] have been named.
*[[Isolt Sayre]], founder of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], wanted to be a Ravenclaw as a child, but never got to attend Hogwarts. Her choice of blue as a colour for the Ilvermorny [[Ilvermorny uniform|school uniform]] was inspired by Ravenclaw.
*No Ravenclaw student Sortings are shown in {{PS|FA}}.
