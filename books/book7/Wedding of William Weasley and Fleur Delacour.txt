==History==
===Prelude to the wedding===
====Engagement====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Molly Weasley|I just think they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all!|Ron Weasley|They’ve known each other a year.|Well, that’s not very long! I know why it's happened, of course. It’s all this uncertainty with [[Tom Riddle|You-Know-Who]] coming back, people think they might be dead tomorrow, so they're rushing all sorts of decisions they'd normally take time over. It was the same [[First Wizarding War|last time he was powerful]], people eloping left, right, and centre...|Bill and Fleur’s seemingly rushed engagement|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}[[File:Bill&Fleur.gif|241x241px|thumb|left|[[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] during their engagement]] [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] began dating in the summer of [[1995]], when they both worked at the [[London]] branch of [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]]. Within a year, they were engaged, and Fleur spent the summer of [[1996]] with Bill’s [[Weasley family|family]] at [[the Burrow]]. The Weasleys were initially not very fond of Fleur, particularly [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]]. His mother, in addition to disliking Fleur’s blunt manner, thought that they were rushing into things because of the stress of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Ginny considered Fleur a "cow," and wished that her older brother was interested in [[Nymphadora Tonks]] instead. On her hand, Mrs. Weasley tried to hide her disapproval for Bill's engagement saying that her son and Fleur were too young, and also that they did not have so much in common, after all, because Bill was a hard-working man and down-to-earth, but Ginny fairly pointed out that Bill wasn't that much.<ref name="HBP5">{{HBP|B|5}}</ref>

{{Dialogue a-b|Mrs. Weasley|Bill and Fleur . . . well . . . what have they really got in common? He’s a hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she’s —|Ginny Weasley|A cow. But Bill’s not that down-to-earth. He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t he, he likes a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour. . . . I expect that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.|Mrs. Weasley and her daughter discuss Bill's and Fleur's personalities.|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
However, after Fleur proved her [[love]] for Bill following his scarring by [[Fenrir Greyback]] during the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] in [[1997]], the Weasleys accepted her. Molly even asked her to wear a [[Muriel's tiara|tiara]] of her Aunt [[Muriel]]’s for the wedding.<ref name="HBP29">{{HBP|B|29}}</ref>

====Wedding preparations====
{{Dialogue|Molly Weasley|I’m so sorry to break up this cosy little gathering. I’m sure you all need your rest…but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.|Ron Weasley|It’s like being a [[house-elf]]. Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll be.|The numerous wedding preparations|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Close-up-look-at-decorations-for-Bill-Fleur-s-wedding-reception-harry-potter-16298472-542-357.jpg|235x235px|thumb|The wedding decorations]]

The wedding preparations began in [[July]] and were particularly stressful, considering that [[Albus Dumbledore]] had only died shortly beforehand and that the [[Order of the Phoenix]] was using the Burrow as its headquarters. The Order also [[Battle of the Seven Potters|evacuated]] [[Harry Potter]] from his [[Dursley family|relatives]]’ home on [[27 July]], leaving the Weasleys with little time to prepare the Burrow. Molly was also keen on trying to keep Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] separated, as she knew they were planning to go off on their own after the wedding and refusing to tell her that it was to [[Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter's Horcrux Hunt|hunt down]] and destroy [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]’s [[Horcrux]]es. She had the trio working around the house as much as possible, and always apart.<ref name="DH6">{{DH|B|6}}</ref>

[[File:Delacour_weasley.jpg|244x244px|thumb|left|Gabrielle, Apolline, Monsieur Delacour and Arthur Weasley]]

On the morning two days before the wedding, Fleur’s parents, [[Delacour sisters' father|Monsieur]] and [[Apolline Delacour]], and her younger sister [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]] arrived at the Burrow, which Harry noted had never been so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and boots that were usually on the steps were replaced by Flutterby bushes, the chickens were shut away, and the garden had been pruned. The Burrow also had many security enchantments placed on it by the Order. The Delacours assisted in the final preparations for the wedding.<ref name="DH6" />

On [[31 July]], there was a [[Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday party|small celebration]] for Harry’s seventeenth birthday. It was interrupted by [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]], who came with [[Arthur Weasley]] and insisted upon speaking to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. He revealed that Dumbledore had bequeathed items to them in his [[The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore|will]], and tried once again to persuade Harry to side with the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Disgusted by the Ministry’s secrecy and high-handedness, Harry refused.<ref name="DH7">{{DH|B|7}}</ref>

===Wedding===
====Arrival of guests====
{{quote|When I get married, I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] on Mum until it’s all over.|[[Fred Weasley]] regarding the wedding|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Deathly Hallows - Harry, Luna and X Lovegood.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]] with the [[Lovegood family|Lovegoods]]]]

Bill and Fleur's wedding began at three o'clock in the afternoon on [[1 August]]. [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[George Weasley|George]], Ron, and Harry — disguised as a Weasley cousin by way of [[Polyjuice Potion]] and the red hair of a [[red-haired Muggle boy]] for security — greeted the guests outside the orchard as they arrived. They all had copies of the seating plan, in order to be able to show guests to the correct golden chair, on either side of the long purple carpet. Inside the marquee, placed there earlier by [[Millamant's Magic Marquees]], were also gold and white flowers. Molly cried a little bit as [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] was the only one who refused to attend.<ref name="DH8"/>

[[File:Viktor & Hermione 1997.jpg|235x235px|thumb|left|[[Viktor Krum]] greets [[Hermione Granger]]]]

Fred led away some [[Veela]] [[Delacour sisters' cousins|cousins]] of the bride, leaving his twin with a “''gaggle of middle-aged witches''”, Ron with [[Perkins]], and Harry with a “''rather deaf old couple''”. Harry then spoke to [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Wedding of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks|newlyweds]] themselves, and to [[Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius]] and [[Luna Lovegood]]. Ron escorted his Great-Aunt [[Muriel]] to her seat, and she insulted him — and many others — the entire way. The group was then met by Hermione who was remarked upon as looking very pretty, and the twins told stories about their late uncle [[Bilius]], to everyone's entertainment.<ref name="DH8"/>

The group's laughter was interrupted by the arrival of [[Viktor Krum]], who immediately complimented Hermione, much to Ron’s irritation. Harry quickly showed Krum to his seat, and then sat down in the second row with Ron and Hermione, behind the twins.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

====Ceremony====
[[File:Wedding1997.gif|250px|thumb|Bill and Fleur in their wedding attire]]

When the guests quieted and the music began, [[William Weasley|Bill]] and his best man, his brother [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], stood at the end of the aisle. Fleur’s bridesmaids, [[Gabrielle Delacour|Gabrielle]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]], walked down the aisle in golden dresses. Escorted by her father, [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]] followed, wearing a simple white dress and [[Muriel's tiara]], and looking radiant.<ref name="DH8"/>

As the couple began to take their vows, several guests began to cry, including [[Molly Weasley]], [[Apolline Delacour]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]], and [[Hermione Granger]]. The [[Ceremony official|wizard]] presiding over the ceremony waved his wand over the bride and groom’s heads, and a shower of stars fell upon their entwined figured. Fred and George led the applause, and the [[Enchanted balloons|golden balloons]] by the newlyweds burst into tiny golden bells and birds of paradise that flew around the tent, singing.<ref name="DH8" />

====Reception====
[[File:Wedding_Ginny&Ron.jpg|252x252px|thumb|left|Ginny talking to Ron during the wedding reception]]

Once Bill and Fleur’s vows were complete, the chairs were magically removed from the tent, the walls of which were removed, so that the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside could be seen. A dance floor was formed, along with tables, and [[Waiters at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding|waiters]] entered with trays of beverages and food as the [[Band at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding|band]] began to play music. While the newlyweds were surrounded by well-wishers, Ron led Harry and Hermione to [[Luna Lovegood]]’s table, partly to avoid [[Muriel]] and [[Viktor Krum]].<ref name="DH8"/>

People began to dance — including Luna by herself and Ginny with [[Lee Jordan]] — and Viktor soon came to sit near Hermione. Ron quickly asked her to dance, and she accepted, pleasantly surprised. When Viktor asked if the two were romantically involved, a disguised Harry replied “sort of”. Viktor then pointed out [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] and the symbol he wore around his neck, which Viktor identified as the [[Gellert Grindelwald's mark|sign]] of [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. He then remarked that Ginny was pretty, and Harry, irritated, immediately claimed that she already had a big, jealous boyfriend.<ref name="DH8"/>

[[File:HarryMurielDoge1.jpg|250x250px|thumb|Harry Potter converses with Mr Doge and Muriel]]

As it grew darker, Harry overheard a conversation between [[Elphias Doge]] and his friend Ron's Aunt [[Muriel]], in which the latter made disparaging remarks about the late [[Albus Dumbledore]] and his [[Dumbledore family|family]]. This marked the beginning of Harry’s suspicions about what his late mentor had failed to tell him about his past and about the mission he left him. Hermione soon joined Harry while Ron went in search of [[butterbeer]]s for the three of them.<ref name="DH8" />

====Disruption====
{{quote|The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.|[[Kingsley Shacklebolt]]’s Patronus arriving at the reception|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:DH1 Kingsley's patronus arrives at wedding.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] warning the guests that the Ministry has fallen]]

The reception was interrupted by the arrival of Kingsley Shacklebolt’s Patronus. This interruption caused everyone, even people dancing to freeze in place, because of the surprise it caused. The Patronus then announced that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] had fallen, as it had been [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|taken over]] by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. The [[Minister for Magic]] [[Rufus Scrimgeour]] was dead and the Death Eaters were currently on their way.<ref name="DH8" /> Panic immediately erupted among the guests and chaos spread. Many began [[Apparition|Disapparating]], just as all the protective enchantments around the Burrow broke.<ref name="DH9"/>

[[File:Hermione escaping the wedding GIF.gif|239x239px|thumb|[[Death Eaters]] storm the wedding]]

Death Eaters began Apparating into the crowd crashing the reception, Order members such as [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] began casting [[Shield Charm]]s, and Harry and Hermione pushed through the mob of terrified guests to try to get to Ron. With Harry’s hand in hers and Ron’s on her free arm, Hermione Disapparated the three of them away to [[Tottenham Court Road]], thus beginning their quest to find the [[Horcrux]]es.<ref name="DH9"/>

Those who remained behind were interrogated by the [[Attack at the Burrow|Death Eaters who arrived]] and wanted information about Harry. No one was seriously hurt. [[Arthur Weasley]] managed to send his Patronus to the trio to tell them this, and to warn them not to try to get into contact, as the [[Weasley family]] was subsequently put under surveillance.<ref name="DH9">{{DH|B|9}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
[[File:Harry at Shell Cottage.gif|240px|thumb|left|Shell Cottage]]

[[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]] set up a new home in [[Shell Cottage]], near the outskirts of [[Tinworth]], [[Cornwall]]. Protected by the [[Fidelius Charm]], its [[Secret-Keeper]] was Bill Weasley. Their home would be used as a safe house for the [[Order of the Phoenix]] playing host to Harry, Ron, Hermione, and others, after they [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor|escaped]] the cellar of [[Malfoy Manor]].<ref name="DH24">{{DH|B|24}}</ref><ref name="DH25">{{DH|B|25}}</ref> The cottage is likely where they raised their three children — [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], and [[Louis Weasley]] — after the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]] in May 1998.

==Behind the scenes==
*[http://www.jennypackham.com/ Jenny Packham], who is a well known fashion wedding designer, designed the outfits for the wedding in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)|film]] of {{DH}}.<ref>http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/fashion-designer-jenny-packham-hired-deathly-hallows-64047/</ref>
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|first part film adaption]] of {{DH}}, in which the wedding took place, several differences were made:
**[[Olympe Maxime|Madame Maxime]] appeared at the wedding in the film version, which is notable since her appearance is not mentioned in the novel.
**The music played at the film version of the wedding is "Humours of Glendart."
**In the film, Fleur Delacour is seen wearing a lavish black and white dress at the wedding. In the book, she is wearing a simple plain white dress.
**In the novel, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] is wearing a golden dress at the wedding. In the film, she is spotted wearing a silver and black dress at the wedding.
**In the film, [[Hermione Granger]] is spotted wearing a red dress robes to [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur]]'s wedding. In the book Hermione is spotted wearing a lilac dress robes at the wedding.
**In the film version, [[Harry Potter]] did not disguise himself as he had in the novel; he went as himself without fearing detection.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, the part of Elphias and Harry's talk about Dumbledore is omitted. Only the part where [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] first meets Harry wearing the necklace of the [[Deathly Hallows]] is shown.<ref name="LEGOHP">{{LEGO|Y2}}</ref>
