'''Barnabas Deverill''' was a master of the [[Elder Wand]] in the early eighteenth century,<ref>{{DH|B|21}}</ref> and "used it to carve himself out a reputation as a fearsome [[warlock]], until his reign of terror was ended" by [[Loxias]] who [[Defeat of Barnabas Deverill|murdered]] Barnabas and mastered the wand.<ref>{{TBB|E}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "''The Tale of the Three Brothers''"''</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Barnabas" is a Greek form of an Aramaic name. In Acts in the New Testament, the byname Barnabas was given to a man named Joseph, a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys. The original Aramaic is unattested, but it may be from בּר נביא (bar naviya') meaning "son of the prophet", though in Acts 4:36 it is claimed that the name means "son of encouragement". As an English name, it came into occasional use after the 12th century.
