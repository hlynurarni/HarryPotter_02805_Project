{{Quote|He were a head case, that Aberforth. Ran wild. 'Course, with his mum and dad gone you'd have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head.

'''Enid Smeek''' (fl.[[1890]]â€”[[1997]]) was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who lived in the outskirts of [[Godric's Hollow]] in the late [[19th century|nineteenth century]], at the same time as the [[Dumbledore family]].<ref name="DH18">{{DH|B|18}}</ref>

She presented [[Rita Skeeter]] her testimony about the [[Dumbledore family|Dumbledores]] for the sensationalist tell-all biography of [[Albus Dumbledore]] that Skeeter wrote in [[1997]], ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'', in which she said Albus's brother [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] used to throw [[goat]] dung at her, and that [[Bathilda Bagshot]], the famed historian, was "''nutty as squirrel poo''".<ref name="DH18"/>

==Etymology==
*The name "Enid" is derived from Welsh enaid meaning "soul" or "life". [[Wikipedia:Enide|Enid]] was the wife of Geraint in Arthurian legend.
