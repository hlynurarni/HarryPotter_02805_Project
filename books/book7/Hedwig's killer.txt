==Biography==

[[File:Hedwig Death GIF.gif|245px|thumb|left|Hedwig gets hit with the [[Killing Curse|Killing curse]]]]
This Death Eater shot out a [[Killing Curse]] that [[Death|killed]] [[Harry Potter]]'s pet [[owl]], [[Hedwig]]. It is likely the curse that killed [[Hedwig]] was intended for [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. He or she most likely took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It is also likely that, after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s defeat in [[1998]], this [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] was either killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for their crimes as a Death Eater.<ref name="DH4"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Hedwig's killer is not explicitly identified, so he/she may have appeared in other [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]], [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]] or [[Harry Potter video games|video games]], but the only known appearance is {{DH}} and {{DH|F1}}.
*A popular fan theory based on book canon suggests that Snape may have killed Hedwig. This theory is based on the idea that Snape was the only death eater who knew there would be several Harry Potters in the sky so as soon as they appeared he was looking for something that distinguished the real Harry Potter before his fellows could grasp the situation in order to eliminate the threat that other death eaters would recognise him. After the Potters were all immediately surrounded by death eaters Hagrid, while manoeuvring the bike accidentally tips it upside down which is followed nearly immediately with a killing curse sent right to Hedwig. The theory suggests that Snape realised that Hedwig was moving around and clearly alive in the cage giving away the real Harry Potter since all the other six hedwigs were clearly motionless stuffed owls compared to her. By killing her he would have ensured that she seemed just like them hiding the identity of the true Harry Potter before flying off to follow a different Harry he knew wasn't the real one.
*According to the films, Hedwig's killer might have been [[Selwyn]], who was known to be pursuing Harry and Hagrid at the time since Hedwig's death in the film happened quite a while into the fight when there was only a couple death eaters following them, or it might have been [[Stanley Shunpike]] under the [[Imperius Curse]].
