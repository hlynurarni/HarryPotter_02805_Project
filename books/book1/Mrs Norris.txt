'''Mrs Norris''' was the pet [[cat]] of [[Argus Filch]], the caretaker of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Mrs Norris was described as having an unusually strong connection with her master, alerting him to any students misbehaving inside the school castle. She was described as appearing almost the same way as Filch, with bulging yellow, lamp-like eyes, a scrawny, skeletal body and dust-coloured fur.<ref name="PS8"/>

==Biography==
===Under Argus Filch's ownership===
[[File:MrsNorris PM.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Mrs Norris on the look out for mischief makers]]
Mrs Norris was born sometime prior to [[1984]], and become the pet cat of the Hogwarts school caretaker, [[Argus Filch]]. She formed an unusually strong bond with her owner, and often alerted him to any misbehaving students almost instantly. Because of this, she along with Filch were widely loathed by most of the Hogwarts student body, and many students had the urge to "''give her a good kick''".<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref>

====1991-1992 school year====
During the [[1991–1992 school year]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] often narrowly escaped the cat on their nightly trips through the school throughout their [[first year]]. Harry once got caught by her one day for tracking mud on the floor.<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref> She and Filch nearly caught Harry, Ron, Hermione and [[Neville Longbottom]] on the night Harry had gone to duel [[Draco Malfoy]]. To avoid them, they hid in a room on the forbidden third floor corridor, and unknowingly encountering [[Fluffy]].<ref name="PS9">{{PS|B|9}}</ref>

During the 1991 Christmas holidays when Harry and Ron first encountered the [[Mirror of Erised]] on a late night stroll, she noticed them being out of bed and wandering around the castle at night. Harry had a suspicion that she was able to see him even when he was under [[Cloak of Invisibility|his Invisibility Cloak]],<ref name="PS12">{{PS|B|12}}</ref> although she may have just sensed someone there but cannot see, as cats are known to possess highly advanced senses that [[human]]s do not have.

In [[1992]], The [[trio]] encountered Mrs Norris at the foot of the stairs as they were wearing Harry's cloak at night, as they were going to the third floor corridor. She merely looked at them, and Ron recommended they kick her; however they just left her and continued to the third floor.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

====1992-1993 school year====
[[File:Trio_writing_on_wall.jpg|250px|thumb|Mrs Norris, petrified on the night of [[31 October]], [[1992]]]]

Mrs Norris was the first victim of the [[Serpent of Slytherin]] when the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was re-opened in [[1992]]. On [[Hallowe'en]] night, she was [[Petrification|petrified]] by the [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|basilisk]] when she saw its reflection in a puddle of [[water]] in front of the unused bathroom, in the second floor. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], possessed by [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]], hung her from a torch bracket by her tail, where she was found by [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]], next to the [[Writing on the Wall|threatening message]] written on the wall.<ref name="COS9">{{COS|B|9}}</ref> Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] examined the cat but was unable to revive her. [[Argus Filch]] was devastated, and even accused Harry Potter of having attacked her.<ref name="COS10">{{COS|B|10}}</ref> Thankfully, Mrs Norris was revived by Professor [[Pomona Sprout]] with the help of a [[Mandrake Restorative Draught]] at the end of the [[1992–1993 school year]].

====1993-1994 school year====
In [[1993]], when Harry obtained the [[Marauder's Map]] from [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], Mrs Norris showed up on the map, alerting the user to her presence, allowing Harry to carefully avoid being caught by her.<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref>

====1994-1995 school year====
[[File:Filch_&_mrs._norris-1-.jpg|150px|thumb|Mrs Norris with Filch at the Yule Ball]]
During the [[1994–1995 school year]], Harry went to sneak into the [[Prefects' Bathroom]] at night wearing his Invisibility Cloak. Harry dropped his [[Golden egg]] behind a tapestry, and Filch and Mrs Norris found it. However, they were disturbed by Peeves who was causing trouble for them again, with Filch believing that Peeves had stolen the egg. When [[Severus Snape]] entered the scene, she left with Filch and Snape to find an intruder who Snape knew was about. Mrs Norris was able to smell Harry's bubblebath.<ref name="GOF25">{{GOF|B|25}}</ref>

On [[Christmas]] day that year, Filch brought her to the [[Yule Ball]] being hosted in the [[Great Hall]].<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref>

Later that school year, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] recommended to [[Hermione Granger]] and Harry that they kidnap Mrs Norris to practise the [[Stunning Spell]] on; however they did not go ahead with Ron's idea.<ref name="GOF29">{{GOF|B|29}}</ref>

====1995-1996 school year====
At the [[1995]] [[Welcoming Feast]], Filch held Mrs Norris as he listened to [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s speech in the [[Great Hall]].<ref name="OOTPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>

During the [[1995–1996 school year]], Harry came across Mrs Norris as he was going to the [[Owlery]] one evening. She came with Filch when he interrogated Harry in the Owlery, where Filch was dismissed by [[Cho Chang]].<ref name="OOTP14">{{OOTP|B|14}}</ref>

In [[December]] [[1995]], Mrs Norris encountered Harry, Ron and [[Minerva McGonagall]] going to the [[Headmaster's Office]] at night. She hissed faintly at them, but McGonagall shooed her away, with her retreating back into the shadows.<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

In [[1996]], [[Peeves]] locked Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour twice after [[Fred and George Weasley]] had instructed him to wreak as much havoc as possible on their [[Fred and George Weasley's departure from Hogwarts|departure]] from the school. Filch personally came to her rescue.<ref name="OOTP30">{{OOTP|B|30}}</ref>

====1996-1997 school year====
During the [[1996–1997 school year]], Mrs Norris encountered Harry, Ron and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] who were having a dispute in a school corridor, in which Ron fired an [[Orange spell]] at Ginny, his sister, which Mrs Norris alerted Filch of.<ref name="HBP14">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref>

Mrs Norris later encountered [[Rubeus Hagrid]], Harry and Hermione at the school at night with Filch, who got into a tense argument with Hagrid over the students being out of bed.<ref name="HBP19">{{HBP|B|19}}</ref>

====1997-1998 school year====

=====Battle of Hogwarts=====
Before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] started, Mrs Norris was seen hissing, screeching and batting at some [[owl]]s who had escaped from the [[Owlery]] to return them to their proper place.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref> 

Mrs Norris was likely put away during the battle, being a cat. She survived the battle, and was with Filch as he swept up debris in the [[Great Hall]], sitting next to a pile of rubble.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Mrs Norris was a dust-coloured cat with bulging yellow, lamp-like eyes,<ref name="eyes"/> and a scrawny skeletal body.<ref name="PS8"/>

==Personality and traits==
Mrs Norris appeared to be a very intelligent and perspective cat, who often looked out for misbehaving students and seemed to be very good at spotting them. She also had an excellent knowledge of [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="PS8"/> She also appeared to have a somewhat hostile temperament, often hissing at people,<ref name="OOTP22"/> but she was very affectionate towards her owner Filch. 

==Relationships==
===Argus Filch===
[[File:Filch-Norris.jpg|thumb|Mrs Norris with her owner, Argus Filch]]
Filch and Mrs Norris had an unusually close bond. Filch was extremely fond and protective of her. Even when patrolling separate corridors, the two seem to be able to communicate and Filch came directly to her when she spotted a student misbehaving.<ref name="PS8"/><ref name="PS9"/> When she was attacked by the basilisk in 1992, Filch's first thought was that she was dead, and he was understandably devastated.<ref name="COS9"/> It is unknown what happened to Mrs Norris after the war.

===Rubeus Hagrid===
{{Quote|An' as fer that cat, Mrs Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to [[Fang]] some time.|Hagrid's intense dislike of Mrs Norris|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[Rubeus Hagrid]] could not stand her; as he was allergic to cats. He suspected that Filch set her up to follow him around whenever he came up to the school. Hagrid once remarked that he would like to introduce her to [[Fang]], his pet [[dog]].<ref name="PS8"/> However, she seemed to respect the other Hogwarts teachers.

===Hogwarts students===
Mrs Norris was hated by a majority of the students. Much like her master, she had an excellent knowledge of the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]]. Being caught misbehaving by her was just as bad as being caught by [[Argus Filch|Filch]], because she would fetch him straight away. It was the "dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick."<ref name="PS8"/>

==Etymology==
Rowling said she obtained the name Mrs Norris from a character in [[Jane Austen]]'s ''Mansfield Park'', who is similarly odious and is hanging around in the background frequently.<ref name="connection">[http://web.archive.org/web/20110724220340/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc2.htm ''The Connection'' interview with J. K. Rowling, available via Web Archive]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Mrs._Norris_LEGO.jpg|thumb|Mrs Norris as a [[LEGO Harry Potter|LEGO]] minifigure]]
[[File:Filch_and_Mrs_Norris_POP.jpg|thumb|Argus Filch and Mrs Norris in [[POP! Vinyl]] form]]
*Mrs Norris seems exceptionally smart for a cat, to the point that many have suspected she is a cat/[[Kneazle]] cross like [[Crookshanks]] or an [[Animagus]]. However, [[J. K. Rowling]] has stated on her website that she is just a highly unpleasant cat. This was confirmed again when Rowling stated on Twitter in response to a fan query that Mrs Norris would lose in a very brutal, close fight with Crookshanks, as Crookshanks's kneazle ancestry would eventually give him the edge.<ref name="fight">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/644197707939213312 J.K. Rowling on Twitter - "It would be brutal and very close..."]</ref>
*Mrs Norris's role in the first two films is much the same as her role in the books. She also appears briefly in the third film and in the fourth and fifth films she, along with Filch, are used more as comic relief. In the fourth film, [[Argus Filch]] is seen dancing with her at the [[Yule Ball]] showing a brief sensitive side to Filch and showing his love for his cat, and on the fifth film Mrs Norris is seen climbing on Filch during the Welcoming Feast, while he is clapping enthusiastically at [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s speech. She has significantly more screen time in the final film; Filch carries her as he runs into the [[Great Hall]] screaming that the students are out of bed, as well at the end of the film, where she is comically sitting next to a pile of rubble as Filch attempts to sweep.
*In the earlier films, Mrs Norris has red eyes. In later films, however, she has blue eyes. Also, in the films, Mrs Norris has brown and grey fur.
*The cat that played Mrs Norris is a Maine Coon. In sharp contrast to Mrs Norris's description in the books as being scrawny, Maine Coons are a large, stocky breed.
*Several animal actors portray Mrs Norris throughout the films. The most notable include Maine Coons named [[Maximus]], [[Alanis]] and [[Cornilus]], and animatronics were also used. Specific animal actors were used for specific purposes. Maximus was trained to run alongside Filch and jump onto his shoulders, while Alanis was trained to be held in Filch's arms without squirming. She was so good at her job that often she fell asleep during shoots.
*It is unknown if she joined the fight with or without [[Argus Filch|Filch]]. It is unknown what happened to her after the war, although given her age of around 14 or possibly older during the Battle of Hogwarts, it is plausible that Mrs Norris had since passed away.
