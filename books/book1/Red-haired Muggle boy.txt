This '''red-haired Muggle boy''' lived in [[Ottery St Catchpole]] in [[Devon]], [[England]] in the [[1990s]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
This boy was presumably born in the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] part of [[Ottery St Catchpole]], a village in [[Devon]], [[England]], and still lived there in [[1997]].

===Wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour===
In order to disguise [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] on [[1 August]], [[1997]], [[Fred Weasley]] stole a few hairs from the head of this boy. It was used to make [[Polyjuice Potion]] for Harry to take on his form. This boy's hair was red in colour, making it possible for Harry to pass as a [[Weasley family|Weasley]] cousin. He was also slightly plump, as Harry mentioned being uncomfortable in his dress robes, for the boy he impersonated was slightly fatter than him. However, it should be noted that Harry wasÂ rather thin.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>
