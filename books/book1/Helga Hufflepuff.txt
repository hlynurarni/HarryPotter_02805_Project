'''Helga Hufflepuff''' (fl. c. [[First millennium A.D.|993]]) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and was one of the [[Hogwarts founders|four founders]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all without preference, but the students of her house are described as loyal and hard-working. Helga's portrait remained at Hogwarts by at least the [[1980s]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|From valley broad....|The [[Sorting Hat]] on Hufflepuff's birthplace|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

Helga Hufflepuff was born in the [[First millennium A.D.|10th Century]] and came from the [[Valleys|broad valleys]] of [[Wales]].<ref name="welsh" /> She was either born or married into the [[Hufflepuff family]]. Helga's greatest friend was [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] from the [[Scotland|Scottish glens]].

===Hogwarts founder===
United by the common goal of creating the world's best magic school<ref>{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref>, Helga Hufflepuff, and her good friends Rowena Ravenclaw, [[Godric Gryffindor]], and [[Salazar Slytherin]] built [[Hogwarts Castle]] together and established [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime around 993. She brought people from different backgrounds together to help in the building of the school.<ref name="FWC">[[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]]</ref>

While the other founders took students based on either ambition, bravery, or intelligence, Helga took the loyal, hard-working, patient and tolerant and treated them all equally.<ref name="OP">{{OOTP}}</ref> She had a gift for [[Food-related charms]], and her recipes are still used as the basis for many Hogwarts feasts.<ref name="WOTM">[[Wizard of the Month]], [https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20070505040312/http://www.jkrowling.com:80/textonly/en/wotm.cfmJ.K. Rowling's official website]</ref> She also arranged for the [[house-elf]] contingent to work in the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchens]], giving them somewhere safe to work, where they would not be mistreated or abused.<ref name="PC">[[J.K. Rowling PotterCast Interview]]</ref>

After a time in which the school enjoyed great prosperity, Helga's fellow founder [[Salazar Slytherin]] proposed a controversial action in which [[Muggle-born]] students should not be admitted to Hogwarts based on their heritage. Hufflepuff and the rest of the founders refused this, however, and the problem escalated to such degrees that Salazar ultimately left the school permanently.

===Post-mortem===
[[File:Helgaaa.gif|thumb|right|Helga Hufflepuff's Famous Wizard card]]
One relic of Hufflepuff's, a [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup|small golden cup]], had been passed down to her distant descendant [[Hepzibah Smith]]. Smith said the cup was supposed to have some magical powers, many of which she hadn't tested. The Cup was stolen from Smith by [[Tom Riddle]], who corrupted Hufflepuff's legacy by changing it into a [[Horcrux]]. However, the Cup was destroyed by [[Hermione Granger]] with a [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|basilisk]] fang during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]].<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Helga was a round, plump woman with brown hair and blue eyes.<ref name="WOTM"/> She often sported a wide smile. Helga usually wore a brown or yellow dress.<ref name="PM"/>

==Personality and traits==
Helga favoured loyalty, honesty, fair play, and hard work, but was known to accept all students regardless of whether or not they possessed these traits. Members of her [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] usually display at least one of these traits in varying degrees. Given that all of her portraits show her with a wide smile, it can be inferred that Helga was a very jolly woman. Her affinity for food-related charms and plump shape might also indicate that she had a large appetite.

Helga was renowned for her compassionate nature and charming ways. She took in the [[house-elves]] to work in [[Hogwarts kitchens|Hogwarts Kitchen]], where they could work in peace and safety. This was considered to be the best option at the time for house-elves. While the other founders were careful in selection of students, Hufflepuff took in the rest.<ref name="GF">{{GOF}}</ref>

She was also a woman of tolerance, willing to accept [[Muggle-born]] students and disagreed with Slytherin's [[pure-blood]] exclusiveness, as well as bringing together people of varying backgrounds to construct the school and ensuring a decent working environment for house-elves, who were generally treated with indifference if not outright cruelty by most wizards.

==Magical abilities and skills==
Hufflepuff was described as being one of the four greatest [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]] of her age.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Helga was highly talented in [[food-related charms]] and many of her recipes are still used in Hogwarts today, testifying to her unique talent as a magical cook.<ref name="WOTM" /> With the help and abilities of her fellow founders, she bewitched the [[Sorting Hat]] into a sentient magical artefact with personality in order to [[Sorting ceremony|sort]] students well after their lifetimes. Furthermore, Helga was capable of conjuring a non-corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]],<ref name="LEGOY2"/> which was a highly advanced piece of [[magic]] as well as a mark of superior magical skill.
*'''[[Magic]]al manufacturing''': Helga created a [[Hufflepuff's Cup|cup]] with special magical powers, which was eventually passed down to her descendant, [[Hepzibah Smith]].

==Possessions==
[[File:Helga Hufflepuff.jpg|356x356px|thumb|Hufflepuff's Cup in Helga's portrait at Hogwarts]]
*'''[[Wand]]''': Hufflepuff owned a wand made of an unknown [[Wand wood|wood]], length, [[Wand core|core]] and flexibility.
*'''[[Hufflepuff's Cup]]''': Hufflepuff owned a cup that was reputed to have special [[magic]]al powers, though these were never revealed. It was eventually passed down through the [[Hufflepuff family]] to [[Hepzibah Smith]]. The cup was stolen by [[Tom Riddle]] and made into one of his [[horcrux]]es.

==Etymology==
*The name '''Helga''' is from Helge, from Old Norse ''heilagr'', meaning "holy" or "blessed". Their symbol is the badger, a large mammal related to the weasels with distinctive white stripes on its head. In Celtic mythology, a badger was a guide. The badger also can symbolise a tendency to be hard-working, strong, and tenacious. Hufflepuffs are known for loyalty and hard work.
*Helga was a name which was common in northern Europe; in countries such as Norway. It was soon adopted by many soviet countries and others which bordered with the north, including; Russia, Latvia, Denmark and Belgium. As those in northern Europe pronounced the 'e' in Helga as more of a cross between 'e' and 'o', and, like the french, didn't pronounce the 'h', the soviet countries adopted the name as 'Olga'. Some countries, including Germany, kept the name as 'Helga'.
*'''Hufflepuff''' could mean "huff and puff" or blustery. "Huff" also means to breathe; "puff" is a medieval term for pastry.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Helga Hufflepuff Portrait WU.png|150px|thumb|A [[Portrait]] of Helga Hufflepuff as seen in {{WU}}]]
*Both Helga and her friend Rowena were referred to as males in the Sorting Hat's song in early German editions and in the German audiobook of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire read by Rufus Beck. This was corrected in later editions of the book.
*Helga Hufflepuff was the May 2007 "[[Wizard of the Month]]" on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s website. Both the famous wizard card and the illustration on Rowling's website depict her as a plump woman with red hair.
*At {{WWHP}}, Helga Hufflepuff speaks in a Welsh accent in her portrait on the Forbidden Journey Ride. This lends further credence to her coming from Wales.
*It is theorised that [[Zacharias Smith]] is related to [[Hepzibah Smith]] and thus is a descendant of Helga Hufflepuff. Although Smith is obviously a very common last name, both Zacharias and Hepzibah are uncommon names of Hebrew origin. It seems unlikely that the two first names are a coincidence. Should Zacharias be truly a descendant of Hufflepuff, this would be an odd irony because he lacks the loyalty and fair play that Hufflepuff's house commands, despite being in her house. It is possible that Zacharias was only put in Hufflepuff because he lacked the qualities needed for the other houses and going by one of the [[Sorting Hat]]'s songs, Hufflepuff did take those at Hogwarts who didn't meet the needs of the other houses.
