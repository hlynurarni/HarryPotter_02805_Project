'''Proudfoot''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|witch or wizard]] who worked for the [[Auror Office]] who was stationed in [[Hogsmeade]] along with [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[John Dawlish]], and [[Savage]] to help heighten security at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] during the [[1996–1997 school year]].<ref name="HBP8">{{HBP|B|8}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Proudfoot could possibly come from the Hobbit family of the same name in J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings''. It is also very close to [[Sirius Black]]'s nickname "Padfoot".
