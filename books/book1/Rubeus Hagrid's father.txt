{{Quote|I could pick him up at the age of 6 and put him on top of the dresser. But enough about me...what about you?|[[Rubeus Hagrid]] discussing his father to [[Olympe Maxime]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

'''Mr Hagrid''' (d. [[1941]]/[[1942]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s father and the first husband of [[Fridwulfa]]. He was short, not only in comparison to his giantess [[Fridwulfa|wife]] and [[half-giant]] [[Rubeus Hagrid|son]], but by human standards as well.

==Biography==
Nothing is known of Mr Hagrid's life before he married the [[Giant|giantess]] [[Fridwulfa]], who gave birth to their son [[Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus]] (a [[half-giant]]) on [[6 December]] [[1928]]. 

Fridwulfa was disappointed with their son's small stature and left the family when Rubeus was three years old, leaving Mr Hagrid heartbroken.<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref>

Mr Hagrid raised his son alone. By the time Rubeus was six, he was large and strong enough to lift his father up onto a dresser if Mr Hagrid annoyed him.<ref name="GOF23" />

Mr Hagrid was at first unsure whether Rubeus could be a wizard, considering his giant blood, but he was delighted when Rubeus received his [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]] in [[1940]]. By that point, Rubeus could carry his father on his shoulders, and Mr Hagrid was described as "beaming" in a photograph taken of them together.<ref name=":0" />[[File:GF 24.jpg|thumb|[[Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus]] and his father]]Mr Hagrid died when Rubeus was in his second year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and therefore he never knew about his son's expulsion from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] the [[1942|next year]].<ref name=":0">{{GOF|B|24}}</ref>
