{{Quote|...[[Dirk Cresswell]] is ten times the wizard you are. And if he survives [[Azkaban]], you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his [[Cresswell brothers|sons]], and his [[Dirk Cresswell's friends|friends]]...|[[Arthur Weasley]] confronts [[Albert Runcorn]] (actually [[Harry Potter]] in disguise)|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
'''Mrs Cresswell''' was the wife of [[Dirk Cresswell]]. She and Dirk had at least [[Cresswell brothers|two sons]] together.<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref>

In [[1997]], Dirk, as a [[Muggle-born]] wizard, arranged to have his family tree falsified to avoid persecution by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]. Unfortunately, [[Albert Runcorn]] uncovered the plan, and Dirk was arrested. [[Arthur Weasley]] confronted Runcorn (who, at the time, was actually [[Harry Potter]] under [[Polyjuice Potion]]), suggesting that, if Dirk made it out of [[Azkaban]] alive, Runcorn would have to answer to Dirk's wife and their sons.<ref name="DH13"/>

Dirk managed to escape before being imprisoned, but, after a few months on the run, he was caught and murdered by [[Snatchers]], leaving Mrs Cresswell a widow.<ref name="DH22">{{DH|B|22}}</ref>
