{{Quote| On the other side of the [[Great Hall|Hall]] Draco Malfoyâ€™s eagle owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from [[Malfoy Manor|home]].|Draco's owl bringing him a package from home in [[1994]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
This was an '''[[eagle owl]]''' owned by [[Draco Malfoy]]. During Malfoy's first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], the [[owl]] delivered daily packages of sweets from [[Narcissa Malfoy|his mother]].<ref name="PS9">{{PS|B|9}}</ref><ref name="GOF13">{{GOF|B|13}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that this was a family owl that sent the packages, but as the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] were wealthy, the owl was likely [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s.

==Appearances==
*{{PS}} {{1st}}
*{{PS|F}}<ref>This owl is named Ulysses, and is owned by an falconry organisation called Knightwings that brings birds of prey to renaissance faires.</ref>
