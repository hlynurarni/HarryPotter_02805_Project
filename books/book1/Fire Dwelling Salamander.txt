'''Fire Dwelling Salamanders''',<ref name="PM">[https://my.pottermore.com/patronus Discover your Patronus - Pottermore]</ref> also called '''Fire Salamanders''',<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref> or just simply '''Salamanders''', were small, [[magic]]al [[fire]] dwelling [[lizard]]s that fed on flames.<ref name="FBR" /><ref name="POA12"/>

==Description==
[[File:Salamander.png|thumb|A Fire Dwelling Salamander]]
Salamanders were born out of [[salamander fire]]s, and lived as long as the flames they were birthed from continue to burn.<ref name="GOFG">{{GOF|G}}</ref> However, if they were fed on [[Black pepper|pepper]], they could survive outside out of its flames for up to six hours.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref> The colour of the Salamander depended on the heat of its birthing fire,<ref name="FBR" /> and produces hot flames itself.<ref name="COSG" /><ref name="GOFG" />
[[File:SalamanderBlood.png|thumb|A bottle of [[Salamander blood]]]]

[[Salamander blood]] had powerful regenerative and [[Healing magic|curative]] properties, and was used as an ingredient in the brewing of many [[potion]]s. The Fire Dwelling Salamander was a rare corporeal form of the [[Patronus Charm]].<ref name="PM" />[[File:Salamander.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The number six, in runic]]
The maximum number of hours a salamander could survive out of fire as well as the number of legs most salamanders had was six, and as such, salamanders were used in the [[Study of Ancient Runes|runic alphabet]] to represent the number six.<ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

[[File:Salamander.jpeg|150px|right|A Salamander basking in its fire]]
There were different types of salamanders, such as the blue and the scarlet variety.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref> [[Scale rot]] was an illness that can affect both salamanders and [[dragon]]s. If left untreated, it could cause a salamander's tail to detach.<ref name="OOTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref> Fire Salamanders were vulnerable to the [[Knockback Jinx]], [[Freezing Spell]]<ref name="POAG" /> and [[water]]-[[Conjuration|conjuring]] [[charm]]s (such as the [[Aqua Eructo Charm]] and the [[Ebublio Jinx]]), as well as [[transfiguration]] [[spell]]s,<ref name="GOFG">{{GOF|G}}</ref> but are resistant to [[Red sparks]] and the [[Fire-Making Spell]].<ref name="COSG" />

There also existed a variant species called the [[Frost Salamander]] that instead of dwelling in fire was closely associated with [[Water|ice]].<ref name="COSG" /><ref name="POAG" />

==History==
[[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] once experimented with feeding fireworks to a salamander, which caused it to rocket around the room, emitting Tangerine stars. The salamander ended up running back into the fireplace in the room, looking scared.<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

In January [[1994]], [[Professor]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]] taught his [[third year]] [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class about these beasts, providing his class with a "bonfire" full of them, with students very much enjoying his lesson, collecting dry wood and leaves to keep their fire blazing while the salamanders scampered up and down the burning logs.<ref name="POA12">{{POA|B|12}}</ref>

In [[1996]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]] mentioned that he needed to rub more [[chilli]] powder on a couple of salamanders that had scale rot.<ref name="OOTP25">{{OOTP|B|25}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite being classified as [[Lizard]]s in {{FB|R}} (meaning they are Reptiles), {{Wplink|Salamander}}s in the real world are in fact Amphibians.
