==Biography==
They were both waiting at [[King's Cross Station]] on [[1 September]], [[1996]] as a security escort for [[Harry Potter]]. Both were described as grim-faced and dressed as [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] in dark suits. Upon the arrival of Harry and the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], the Aurors quickly escorted them into the station without speaking, although Harry found his escort's over-protectiveness somewhat irritating.<ref name="HBP7">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
It is possible that one of them was [[Gawain Robards]].
