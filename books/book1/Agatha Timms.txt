'''Agatha Timms''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who owned an eel farm.

==Biography==
At the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in [[1994]], she bet [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]] that the match would last a week, wagering 50% co-ownership of her farm.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

[[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo]] referred to her as ''"little Agatha Timms,"'' presumably indicating that she was either diminutive in stature, or much younger than him.<ref name="GOF7"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the early German translation, Agatha owns an [[owl]] farm, in later editions corrected to eel farm.

==Etymology==
The name "Agatha" is the Latinized form of the Greek name Αγαθη (Agathe), derived from Greek αγαθος (agathos) meaning "good". Saint Agatha was a 3rd-century martyr from Sicily who was tortured and killed after spurning the advances of a Roman official. The saint was widely revered in the Middle Ages, and her name has been used throughout Christian Europe (in various spellings). The mystery writer Agatha Christie (1890-1976) was a famous modern bearer of this name.
