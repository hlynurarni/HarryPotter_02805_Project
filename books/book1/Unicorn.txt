{{Quote|Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The [[blood]] of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from [[death]], but at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure and defenceless to save yourself, you will have but a half-life, a [[curse]]d life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.|The properties of [[unicorn blood]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

The '''Unicorn''' was a white [[horse]] with a [[Unicorn horn|horn]] sticking out of its head. An iconic [[creature]] of [[magic]], the existence of unicorns was one of the worst-kept secrets of the [[wizarding world|wizarding&nbsp;world]], as unicorns were inextricably associated with magic in the [[Muggle world]].<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref> These majestic equines possessed potent magical properties, with their [[Unicorn hair|tail hairs]] being designed by [[Garrick Ollivander]] as one of the "[[Wand core|Supreme Cores]]," which was a distinction shared by only two other [[beast]]s.

==Description==
[[File:BabyUnicorn.png|thumb|left|A unicorn foal]]
[[File:UnicornFBE.png|thumb|right|An adult Unicorn]]
[[File:UnicornFB.jpg|thumb|right|A wild Unicorn]]
Unicorn foals were born pure gold in colour. They remained so until they were about two years old, at which time they turned silver in colour. At around four years old their horn grew in. They were fully grown at about seven years old, at which at this age they turned a shade of pure white that was so bright that it made freshly fallen [[Water|snow]] looked grey in comparison. Their hooves were golden (remaining so from their gold stage, the first two years of their life), and their [[Unicorn blood|blood]] was silver-blue and shone under the moonlight. It was not mentioned how long a Unicorn can live for.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

Unicorns inhabited the forests of [[Europe]], including the [[Forbidden Forest]] by [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="GOF24"/>

Unicorns preferred a woman's touch, but the young ones were more trusting and do not mind men as much. Unicorns are also so fleet of the hoof that they can rarely be caught by [[human]]s. They were also fast enough to outrun [[Werewolf|werewolves]] with absurd ease. [[Wandmaker]]s such as the [[Ollivander family]] also plucked [[Unicorn hair|hairs]] from the tails of the creatures to use in [[wand]]s as [[Wand core|cores]]. Not aggressive without cause, but should be treated with great respect.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

Unicorns were capable of moving faster than [[Werewolf|Werewolves]]. During the detention in the Forbidden Forest in [[1992]], Harry asked if a werewolf could be killing the unicorns and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] replied that they were not fast enough to catch Unicorns.<ref name="PS15">{{PS|B|15}}</ref>

Unicorns were considered pure and sacred creatures. Drinking their blood to preserve one’s life was considered a heinous and immoral crime.

==Uses==
[[File:UnicornSlaying.png|220px|thumb|A [[Slytherin Dungeon tapestries|Medieval tapestry]] depicting wizards slaying a unicorn, and collecting [[Unicorn blood|its blood]]]]

Various parts of the Unicorn — the [[Unicorn horn|horn]] and [[Unicorn hair|tail hair]] in particular — were used in potions. [[Unicorn hair]] in general was used for the [[wand core|cores]] of [[wand]]s. Unicorn hair can be used in wandmaking; they produce the most consistent [[magic]], least subject to fluctuations and blockages, most difficult to turn to the [[Dark Arts]] and the most faithful of wands. However, they did not make the most powerful of wands and were prone to melancholy if mishandled, although the [[wand wood]] can compensate this. The [[Wandmaker]] [[Garrick Ollivander]] made wands with unicorn hair cores.<ref>[http://lady-slytherin-forever.tumblr.com/post/8977640199/wand-cores-off-of-pottermore New Wandcore information from pottermore]</ref>

The tail hair can also be used as binding in bandages due to its incredible strength.<ref>{{HBP}}</ref> The [[Unicorn blood|blood of a unicorn]] can be used to keep a person who is near death alive, thus granting the drinker [[immortality]], but "''you will have but a half-life, a [[curse]]d life, from the moment the blood touches your lips''."<ref name="PS15">{{PS|B|15}}</ref> Unicorn horn is often used as a common [[potion]] ingredient, in potions such as the [[Antidote to Common Poisons]], [[Draught of Peace]] and [[Wiggenweld Potion]].

The unicorn's single straight horn was used, in the [[Study of Ancient Runes]], to symbolise the number one as a [[Rune|runic]] number symbol.<ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

A unicorn was one rare possible corporeal form of the [[Patronus Charm]].<ref>{{see image|File:Unicorn-patronus.jpg}}</ref>[[Constance Pickering]]'s [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] took the form of a unicorn.<ref name="BabyBeasts">{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: Baby Beasts"</ref>

==History==
[[Merula Snyde's mother]] owned a unicorn for a short period.<ref>{{HM|4}} onward, Care of Magical Creatures Lessons, in general, </ref>

[[File:Unicorns death.jpg|250px|thumb|A dead unicorn in [[1992]]]]
At least two unicorns were slain by [[Quirinus Quirrell]] so [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] could drink their [[Unicorn blood|blood]] and return to power. [[Harry Potter]], [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Fang]] found the corpse of one of them in the [[Forbidden Forest]].<ref name="PS15">{{PS|B|15}}</ref>

[[File:B4C24M1 a lesson on unicorns.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Professor Grubbly-Plank]] showing her class some unicorns]]
{{Quote|The Unicorn was so brightly white that it made the snow all around look grey. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves, and throwing back its horned head|Description of a majestic Unicorn in a 1995 Care of Magical Creatures lesson|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
In [[1995]], [[fourth year]] students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] studied unicorns in their [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class, while [[Professor]] [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank]] was standing in for [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].<ref name="GOF24">{{GOF|B|24}}</ref>

Later, in the [[1995-1996 school year]], as part of the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] Care of Magical Creatures practical examination, students were required to choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick Unicorn.<ref name="OOTP31">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref>

During the [[Calamity]] in the [[2010s]], several baby Unicorn [[Foundable]]s were being guarded by large, aggressive red [[snake]]s [[Confoundable]]s, which appeared throughout the [[Wizarding world]]. Volunteer members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] had to repel the giant serpents with the [[Exploding Charm]] to stun them and liberate the baby Unicorns, allowing the Foundables to return to their rightful place.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Unicorn_FBCFTWW.png|220px|thumb|A unicorn as shown on {{FBC}}]]
[[File:Unicorn Patronus.png|220px|thumb|A unicorn [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]]]
*The {{wplink|unicorn}} was a creature that the ancient Greeks believed resided in [[India]]. Though commonly depicted in modern fantasy (as in ''Harry Potter'') as being a [[horse]] with a single horn, unicorns in antiquity were also described as [[goat]]s, wild [[donkey]]s, or some form of a hybrid creature. The concept of them being more comfortable with [[Wizardkind|witches than wizards]] possibly stems from [[Middle Ages|medieval]] beliefs that only a maiden could tame a unicorn.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] tries to sneak up on the unicorn with a knife and fork, but is scared off by [[Firenze]] who shows him his fist. [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] then proceeds to care for the sick unicorn like a child.<ref>{{LEGO|Y1}}</ref>
*It is possible the author was inspired to place Unicorns within the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts, based on the fact that the unicorn is the national animal of [[Scotland]], where Hogwarts is located.
*The unicorn is one of the nine possible Patronus forms for [[Jacob's sibling]]. It can be achieved by having a higher Empathy stat or choosing the option "protect friends" and later, choosing "Equine" as the Patronus form.<ref>{{HM|4|Conjure a Patronus}}</ref>
