'''Narcissa Malfoy''' (née '''Black'''), (b. [[1955]]) was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]]<ref name="blood" /> [[Wizardkind|witch]], the youngest daughter of [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]] and [[Druella Black]] (née [[Rosier family|Rosier]]), younger sister of [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and [[Andromeda Tonks]], wife of [[Lucius Malfoy]], mother of [[Draco Malfoy]], and the grandmother of [[Scorpius Malfoy]]. 

Although never officially a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] herself, Narcissa believed in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]] and supported her husband in following [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War|First]] and [[Second Wizarding War]]s.<ref name="Online Chat">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html Online Chat with JK]</ref> This changed, however, when her [[Lucius Malfoy|husband]] was incarcerated in [[Azkaban]] and her [[Draco Malfoy|son's]] life was put in jeopardy by Voldemort. Narcissa took necessary measures to protect her family, including lying to Voldemort about [[Harry Potter]] being dead during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], an act which saved the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] from serving time in Azkaban following the Dark Lord's defeat.<ref name="Online Chat" />

Narcissa survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and later had a grandson, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy]], through her son's marriage to [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]]. However, Narcissa disliked Astoria for her stance on blood tolerance.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Narcissa, Andromeda, and Bellatrix.jpeg|229x229px|thumb|left|A young Narcissa (left) with her older sisters, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]]]]

Narcissa Black was the youngest daughter of [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]] and [[Druella Black]] (née [[Rosier family|Rosier]]), born in [[1955]] in the aristocratic [[House of Black]]. She had two older sisters, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]].<ref name="BFT">Black family tree</ref> Narcissa was taught the philosophy of [[Blood status|blood purity]] from a young age and grew up prejudiced in favour of [[pure-blood]]s. Thus, like her sister Bellatrix, she cut off contact with her sister Andromeda after she was disowned and burned off the [[House of Black#Family Tree|Black family tree]] for marrying [[Muggle-born]] wizard [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]].<ref name="DH">{{DH}}</ref>

Narcissa was educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from c. [[1966]]-[[1973]]. Sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]], she met her future husband, [[Lucius Malfoy]], whilst at Hogwarts.<ref name="CS">{{COS}}</ref>

===First Wizarding War===
Narcissa married [[Lucius Malfoy]], who was just as wealthy and pure-blood inclined as the Black family Narcissa descended from, between [[1972]] and [[September]] [[1979]].<ref>The first date, 1972, is when Narcissa turned 17 and was eligible for marriage; the second date, September 1979, is nine months before Draco's birth, at which point she had to be married to Lucius.</ref> The [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] lived a life of privilege and luxury at [[Malfoy Manor]], located in the southern English county of [[Wiltshire]]. Her husband introduced Narcissa to the lifestyle of the [[Death Eaters]], though she never became a Death Eater herself. The couple had one son, named [[Draco Malfoy|Draco Lucius]]. Narcissa thus continued her family tradition of naming children after stars and constellations, like her sisters (Andromeda and Bellatrix).

[[File:B4C30M1 Wizengamot trial Pensieve memory.png|250x250px|thumb|Narcissa's relatives: [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Rodolphus Lestrange|Rodolphus]], and [[Rabastan Lestrange]] before the Council of Magical Law]]

Narcissa's cousin [[Regulus Black]] was killed in the [[First Wizarding War]], while her other cousin [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and sister Bellatrix were both sentenced to [[Azkaban]] after Voldemort's fall in [[1981]].<ref name="OTP">{{OOTP}}</ref> Lucius was able to avoid a similar fate by claiming that he had been under the effects of the [[Imperius Curse]], and the Malfoys remained members of the social elite, enjoying close relationships with [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] officials such as [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] and Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic [[Dolores Umbridge]]. In privacy, however, they regretted the downfall of Voldemort as they saw the purification of the wizarding race to have failed completely, regrets that they told their son not to reveal, lest it would bring their family trouble.

===Between the wars===
[[File:NarcissaLookingOverShoulder Still.jpg|240x240px|thumb|left|Narcissa and her grandeur appearance during this time]] 

When the time came for [[Draco Malfoy]] to begin school in [[1991]], Lucius Malfoy wanted him to attend [[Durmstrang Institute]], which only admitted [[pure-blood]] and [[half-blood]] students and taught the [[Dark Arts]], which closely mirrored the Malfoy family beliefs. Narcissa, however, insisted that Draco attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] instead so he would be closer to home, as Durmstrang was located in northern Europe. She was very devoted to Draco, sending him sweets and cakes by [[owl]] every day during his first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name="PS">{{PS}}</ref>

Narcissa attended the [[Quidditch World Cup]] in [[1994]] with her husband and son, watching the game from Fudge's luxury box.<ref name="GOF">{{GOF}}</ref>

===Second Wizarding War===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Severus Snape|Now... you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?|Narcissa Malfoy|Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and... The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it. He wishes none to know of the plan. It is... very secret.|But — If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. The Dark Lord’s word is law.|There! Even Snape says so: [[Bellatrix Lestrange|You]] were told not to talk, so hold your silence!|Narcissa asking Snape for desperate help|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Callejonmalfoys.jpg|227x227px|thumb|Narcissa and Draco after their fall from grace and Lucius' imprisonment]]
In [[1996]], her sister and brother-in-law escaped Azkaban. That same year, Lucius participated in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] in an attempt to acquire a [[Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy|prophecy]] for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], who had returned to power the previous year. Narcissa provided Voldemort with the information he needed to get Harry there after she gained it from Kreacher the House Elf, who gave it to her both because she was a Black by birth and because she treated the attention starved house elf more kindly than her cousin Sirius Black, the elf's current master, did. The effort was thwarted by six [[Dumbledore's Army|D.A.]] members and members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. Voldemort was furious with Lucius, who had led the effort, both for failing to obtain the prophecy and for the consequences of that night, which included the Dark Lord's return being recognised by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and many of his Death Eaters being sent to Azkaban, including Lucius himself.<ref name="OTP" />

Though her sister Bellatrix managed to escape imprisonment, Narcissa was distraught over her husband's incarceration, as well as Voldemort's subsequent treatment of her family. That summer, she ventured to [[Severus Snape]]'s home at [[Spinner's End]], accompanied by Bellatrix, to discuss Voldemort's orders for Draco to murder Hogwarts Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]].

[[File:Unbreakable-vow.jpg|235px|thumb|left|Bellatrix performs the [[Unbreakable Vow]] on Narcissa and Severus in order to protect Draco]]

Narcissa was hysterical and theorised that Draco was being sent on a suicide mission to punish Lucius for his numerous failures. Despite the pleading of her sister to the contrary, Narcissa brushed off Bellatrix scoffing when Narcissa claimed that "the Dark Lord [was] mistaken," and begged Severus to make an [[Unbreakable Vow]], which ensured that he would watch over Draco during his efforts. She also made him vow to execute the plan himself, should Draco fail to do so. 

Later that month, Narcissa went shopping for school supplies with Draco at [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions]], where she had a heated confrontation with [[Harry Potter]] and his friends. He taunted her about Lucius's imprisonment, and she responded by coldly alluding to the recent death of [[Sirius Black|his godfather]], after which she haughtily departed with her son to [[Twilfitt and Tatting's]], as she did not wish to shop at Madam Malkin's anymore.

Throughout the school year, Draco enacted a series of unsuccessful attempts to kill Dumbledore, which eventually resulted in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and Snape's fulfilment of his vow to Narcissa.<ref name="HBP">{{HBP}}</ref>

====Home as headquarters====
[[File:DH1_Lucius_Malfoy,_Narcissa_Malfoy_and_Bellatrix_Lestrange.jpg|245x245px|thumb|Lucius, Narcissa, and her sister Bellatrix talking to Lord Voldemort during the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor]]]]

By [[1997]], Malfoy Manor was being used as a headquarters for Voldemort. A [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting]] of Lord Voldemort's inner circle was held there, and the murder of [[Charity Burbage]] took place in the drawing room. The Malfoys were extremely uncomfortable with the arrangements, despite their claims that nothing would please them more than to host the Dark Lord. After Lord Voldemort asked for a borrowed wand, Narcissa coaxed her husband into agreeing to give his wand to Voldemort; it was soon broken in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]].

Voldemort was still displeased with the Malfoys for Lucius's earlier failures and delighted in humiliating them by taunting their relation to [[werewolf]] [[Remus Lupin]] through Narcissa's niece, [[Nymphadora Tonks]].<ref name="DH" />

====Skirmish at Malfoy Manor====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Bellatrix Lestrange|Draco, move this scum outside.

The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy!|[[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] and Narcissa arguing in Malfoy Manor|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Narcissa-and-Draco-Malfoy-with-Bellatrix-narcissa-malfoy-28196485-1920-800.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Narcissa with her son, Draco fighting off [[Harry Potter]] and Ron Weasley]]

When Harry Potter, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] were caught by a group of [[Snatchers]] led by [[Fenrir Greyback|Greyback]], they were brought to [[Malfoy Manor]]. Narcissa acted coldly and disdainfully towards Scabior but let them in, where she called on her son to identify the prisoners and recognised Hermione from their encounter a year earlier in [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions]].

Narcissa clashed with her sister over who had authority in her home, and therefore over the prisoners held in her cellar: Harry, Ron, [[Dean Thomas]], [[Griphook]], [[Garrick Ollivander]], and [[Luna Lovegood]], the latter two of which had been held there for some time. All the prisoners escaped: Dean, Luna and Ollivander Disapparating with Dobby, while Harry and Ron went to save Hermione from Narcissa's sister, Bellatrix, who had used the [[Cruciatus Curse]] to brutally torture her with. Later, in the brief duel that followed, Narcissa was shocked to see her family's former [[house-elf]], [[Dobby]], openly defying them. He was eventually murdered by Bellatrix as the group escaped the manor.<ref name="DH" />

[[File:Narcissa 1998.jpg|250px|thumb|Narcissa is present when Voldemort murders goblins]]

After Harry and his friends escaped to [[Shell Cottage]], Lord Voldemort severely punished the Malfoy family, but did not act as harsh on Bellatrix. By the time of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Narcissa had given her son, [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], her wand to use in lieu of his own stolen wand, leaving both herself and her husband wandless. She was also present when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] interrogated and murdered goblins in a fit of anger after learning of Harry Potter's [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] break-in and theft of one of his Horcruxes.

====Battle of Hogwarts====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Narcissa Malfoy|Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?|Harry Potter|Yes.|He is dead!|Narcissa lies about Harry being dead, thus betraying [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}} 
Towards the beginning of the battle, Draco lost his mother's wand in the [[Room of Requirement]], leaving it to be incinerated by [[Vincent Crabbe]]'s [[Fiendfyre]].

[[File:NarcissaCheckingIfHarryIsDead.png|250px|thumb|left|Narcissa checking if Harry is dead on Voldemort's orders]]

During the final phase of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Voldemort attempted to kill Harry Potter in the [[Forbidden Forest]] using the [[Killing Curse]]. Voldemort demanded that someone check to see if Harry was, in fact, dead, a deed no one wanted to perform. Perhaps seeing an opportunity to discover her son's current condition, Narcissa volunteered. Seeing that Harry was still alive, she used the opportunity to covertly ask Harry if he knew of Draco's well-being. In a whisper, she asked if [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] was alive. When Harry replied quietly that he was, Narcissa betrayed the Dark Lord and asserted that [[Harry Potter]] was dead. She knew the only way her family would be reunited was as part of Voldemort's conquering army, thus proving she loved her family more than she supported Voldemort.

[[File:Voldemort vanquished.png|250px|thumb|Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]]]]

When the battle recommenced, Narcissa and [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]] abandoned the [[Death Eaters]] and searched frantically for Draco. The family was present for Bellatrix's death at the hands of [[Molly Weasley]] and for Harry Potter's final defeat of Lord Voldemort, thus ending the Second Wizarding War. After the battle, the family was reunited in the [[Great Hall]], where they seemed uncomfortable with their predicament, but did not leave.

===Later life===
However, as Narcissa betrayed Voldemort and left him, the entire Malfoy family was granted a reprieve and avoided incarceration in [[Azkaban]]. Narcissa would eventually become a grandmother to [[Scorpius Malfoy]], the son of Draco and his wife [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]].

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn’t been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose.|Narcissa's appearance|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Narcissa Malfoy promo.jpg|221x221px|thumb|left|A middle aged Narcissa]]

Narcissa Malfoy was described as tall, slim, "nice looking", and very pale, with blue eyes, long blonde hair, and a clear, cold voice.<ref name="hair" /><ref name="skin&hair" /><ref name="eyes" /><ref name="GOF" /> Her hair colouring thus differed from most of the [[House of Black]], who generally had dark hair, though Narcissa did possess the arrogant good looks that are a common characteristic of her family. Despite her physical differences to her sisters, Bellatrix and Andromeda, [[Harry Potter]] did describe her as resembling Bellatrix somewhat, though Narcissa was as fair as Bellatrix was dark.

Narcissa's beauty was somewhat marred by her donning an expression that suggested that she was sniffing dung whenever she was in the company of those she considered her inferiors. Harry Potter once insulted her son Draco by asking if she only had this expression when Draco was with her.<ref name="GOF" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Now that I know the kind of scum that shops here...we'll do better at [[Twilfitt and Tatting's]].|Narcissa displaying prejudice|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Narcissa_Black.jpg|200x200px|thumb|right|Narcissa on the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]]]]
Narcissa was a very proud woman who frequently displayed a haughty and disdainful attitude, looking down upon others  as she believed strongly in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]] and valued her family's wealth. She was prejudiced towards [[Muggle-born]]s, other non-[[pure-blood]]s such as [[Fenrir Greyback]], and so-called "[[blood traitor]]s". For example, she once rudely exclaimed to the owner of Madam Malkin's that she would rather shop at Twilfitt and Tatting's instead since Madam Malkin's served "scum" such as [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].<ref name="HBP" /> Despite her beliefs and her family's close ties to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the [[Death Eaters]], Narcissa never joined the organisation herself, nor received the [[Dark Mark]]. 

While she treated most people coldly, Narcissa was very loving towards her family as well as devoted to them. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep her son safe when he was put in danger during the [[Second Wizarding War]], from begging [[Severus Snape]] to take an [[Unbreakable Vow]] to help him<ref name="HBP" /> to lying to Voldemort himself.<ref name="DH" /> She cared deeply about her husband and son and displayed a fierce and protective temper on their behalf, as well as a ruthless determination to keep them safe.<ref name="DH" /><ref name="HBP" />  Narcissa had a close relationship with her sister Bellatrix despite their differing temperaments and personality traits. Narcissa always despised the Blacks who dared to defy their family's beliefs, such as her sister [[Andromeda Tonks]] and cousin [[Sirius Black]],  leading  her to ignore and disown them.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Love]]''': Narcissa loved her [[Lucius Malfoy|husband]] and [[Draco Malfoy|son]] dearly, and was willing to do anything to protect them, such as securing an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with [[Severus Snape]], to ensure that Draco had some form of protection.<ref name="HBP"/> Narcissa's love also drove her to lie to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself, which was instrumental both for locating Draco, and for Voldemort's final defeat at the hands of [[Harry Potter]]. This also indirectly ensured Harry was protected again by a mother's love. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]], she did not attempt to participate in the fight, but searched everywhere for her son along with her husband until they eventually found him.<ref name="DH"/> 
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Narcissa was described as being a practising [[Dark Wizard|dark witch]] by her former [[house-elf]] [[Dobby]], who was known for being highly truthful.<ref name="GOF"/> Her [[House of Black|Black family]] background and association with the Death Eaters, also very strongly adds to her connection with dark magic. 
[[File:Skirmish malfoy manor.gif|thumb|Narcissa and Draco duelling Harry and Ron at Malfoy Manor]]
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Though not as powerful as her [[Bellatrix Lestrange|prodigious sister]], Narcissa was a proficient duellist in her own right, and was actually one of the very few who were unafraid to stand up to Bellatrix: she once used magic to repel her sister to such extent that Bellatrix, who was grasping Narcissa's hand, "let go of her sister's hand as though burned".<ref name="DH"/> She seemed confident in her ability to duel the likes of both [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] when they threatened to attack her son Draco in [[Madam Malkin's]],<ref name="HBP"/> and she later duelled them during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]] by firing various offensive [[spell]]s at them, managing to successfully stand her ground against them.<ref name="DH"/> It is also possible that she took part in the first part of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Narcissa appeared to be a mistress of Apparition, perhaps even more skilled than Bellatrix. This was demonstrated when they both apparated into [[Spinner's End]], with Narcissa making only a slight "popping" sound and Bellatrix's pop being somewhat louder.<ref name="HBP"/> With Apparition, it was generally considered that the quieter the 'pop', the more skilled at Apparition that [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]] is, although Bellatrix may simply have been too desperate in chasing Narcissa to do it more quietly.
*'''[[Occlumency]] (possibly)''': Though it was never confirmed, it was still implied that Narcissa was probably a skilful Occlumens, due to her ability to effectively lie to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] himself, who was believed to be the most accomplished [[Legilimency|Legilimens]] of his time. However, it should be noted that Voldemort might not have been using Legilimency when Narcissa lied about [[Harry Potter|Harry]]'s death, and the fact that it was her [[Bellatrix Lestrange|sister]] who taught [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] Occlumency must also be taken into consideration.

==Possessions==
[[File:Narcissa_Malfoy_wand.png|thumb|Narcissa's first wand]]
*'''[[Narcissa Malfoy's wand|Wand]]''': Narcissa owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core]]. She gave her wand to her son [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] after his own [[Draco Malfoy's wand|wand]] was stolen by [[Harry Potter]] during the [[Skirmish at Malfoy Manor]].
*'''[[Narcissa Malfoy's second wand|Second Wand]]''': Narcissa owned a second wand that she used during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], which was also of unknown specifics.
*'''[[Narcissa Malfoy's spider earrings|Earrings]]''': By 1996, Narcissa owned and wore elegant earrings in the form of a [[spider]].

==Relationships==
===Family===
====Lucius Malfoy====
{{Quote|Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my husband!|Narcissa defending her husband to her sister Bellatrix|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:LuciusMalfoy.jpg|214x214px|thumb|Lucius Malfoy, her husband and father of her son]]

Narcissa and her husband, [[Lucius Malfoy]], appear to have an affectionate relationship. He gave in to her wishes when she wanted their son to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], rather than [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]. Lucius also allowed his wife to continue the Black Family naming custom of stars and constellations through their son, showing obvious respect for her family and deference to herself. Narcissa and Lucius both enjoyed being members of the social elite, and loved and spoiled their only child. Unlike Bellatrix, who did not hold love for her [[Rodolphus Lestrange|husband]], Narcissa truly loved Lucius.<ref name="HBP" />

Narcissa was very upset when he was briefly imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] and became defensive when others mentioned his failures.<ref name="HBP" /> In [[1997]], when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] took over their home and demanded that Lucius give him his wand, Lucius looked to his wife in disapproval, and only when she touched his wrist did he turn it over.<ref name="DH" />

====Draco Malfoy====
{{Quote|If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do.|Narcissa coldly threatens Harry Potter and Ron Weasley|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Draco malfoy fourth.jpg|221x221px|thumb|left|Draco Malfoy, her son]]

Narcissa adored her only child, [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]], and was very protective of him. She insisted he not attend the [[Durmstrang Institute]] because it was so far from home, and frequently sent him sweet and [[cake]] packages while during his first year at Hogwarts.

{{Quote|That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius’s mistake, I know it!|Narcissa's concern for her son|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
Narcissa was terrified to the point of hysteria when Draco was ordered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Narcissa suspected that [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] meant him to fail as punishment for [[Lucius Malfoy|her husband]]'s failure in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]]. To help him, Narcissa went to [[Severus Snape]] and begged for his assistance, whereupon she asked of him to make the [[Unbreakable Vow]] in which he promised to take over Draco's task if he failed.<ref name="HBP" /> Later on in the [[Second Wizarding War|war]], she tried to shelter Draco as much as possible. During the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Narcissa lied to the Dark Lord about [[Harry Potter]]'s death so she and Lucius would be able to search for Draco in the castle.<ref name="DH" /> Draco, in turn, held his mother in great esteem, and became extremely angry if anyone insulted her.

====Astoria Greengrass====
Narcissa and her husband Lucius didn't think highly of her, as she raised their grandson Scorpius to have a more tolerant view on Muggles (and likely Muggle-borns, half-bloods, Squibs or even non-human magical creatures).

Because of this, family gatherings are often fraught with tension. It is likely they see Astoria as a blood traitor because of this. Her relationship with Scorpius is unknown.

====Bellatrix Lestrange====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Bellatrix Lestrange|Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me.|Narcissa Malfoy|Go back, Bella!|You must listen to me!|I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me alone!|Narcissa having a disagreement with her sister|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[File:Bellatrix-promo-bellatrix-lestrange-28967562-470-627.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Bellatrix Lestrange, her elder sister]]

Narcissa appeared to have a fairly affectionate and close relationship with her older sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]]. The two fondly called each other by their nicknames of "Cissy" and "Bella". Bellatrix accompanied Narcissa to see Snape at [[Spinner's End]], in spite of her distrust for [[Severus Snape]] and belief that they should not discuss the task [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] assigned in secret.<ref name="HBP"/>

Narcissa was also one of the only people who was able to question Bellatrix's authority without unleashing Bellatrix's anger. The two sometimes clashed over Draco, as Narcissa was concerned about his welfare, while Bellatrix coldly stated her belief that he was doing his duty by serving Voldemort and that Narcissa should be proud.<ref name="HBP" />

It is not known whether Narcissa knew about Bellatrix's daughter from Voldemort, but [[Delphini]] was born at the Malfoy Manor. If Narcissa did know, then it is possible that she continued to keep this a secret for many years to come to protect not only her niece but also her own family from any public reaction to the idea that the Dark Lord had a child and this child was born at the Malfoys' home.

====Andromeda Tonks and Sirius Black====
Narcissa did not hold her late cousin [[Sirius Black]] or her older sister, [[Andromeda Tonks]], in high regard, presumably because they were both "[[blood traitor]]s" who were disowned by the [[House of Black|Black family]]. Bellatrix claimed that she and Narcissa had not seen Andromeda since she married [[Muggle-born]] wizard [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], which would have occurred in the early [[1970s]]. Narcissa also mercilessly threw Sirius's death in [[Harry Potter]]'s face when he taunted her about Lucius's imprisonment in [[1996]].<ref name="HBP" /> For his part, Sirius held his cousin in contempt for her prejudiced beliefs.<ref name="OTP" /> Since Narcissa broke all ties with her sister Andromeda, she most likely didn't care either for her niece, [[Nymphadora Tonks]], and didn't consider her to be a part of the family.

Harry held Narcissa in contempt due to his rivalry with her son and hatred of her husband. In the same respect, Narcissa held Harry and his friends in disdain and contempt: especially [[Hermione Granger]], as she was [[Muggle-born]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], as he was a [[blood traitor]]. Narcissa also held Harry in contempt for being Dumbledore's favourite student and associating with those whom she considered to be inferior.<ref name="HBP"/>

When Voldemort "killed" Harry in the Forbidden Forest, she asked him whether Draco was still alive, as she knew that the only way she and Lucius could search for Draco inside Hogwarts would be as part of Voldemort's victorious army. Though she disliked Harry, she placed her family's welfare over Voldemort's goals. On confirming Draco's very much alive status, she plainly lied that Harry Potter was "dead". Harry was indeed ''not'' dead and was just pretending to be dead. This action of hers was both very crucial and important, not only for Harry's survival but for Voldemort's final defeat as well, thus ensuring Harry was again protected by a mother's love, although indirectly.<ref name="DH"/> Since Draco had made peace with Harry after this, Narcissa probably just chose to leave Harry in peace.

===Severus Snape===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b|Narcissa Malfoy|Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?|Severus Snape|I will|And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?|I will|And, should it prove necessary... if it seems Draco will fail... will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?|I will.|Narcissa making an [[Unbreakable Vow]] with Snape|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
[[file:Severus Snape OOTP.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Severus Snape]]]] 
Like Draco, Narcissa held Severus Snape in high esteem and trusted him due to him being an old friend of Lucius's. Unlike her son, she continued to invest her faith in him despite Lucius's imprisonment and Bellatrix Lestrange, her older sister, voicing doubts about him. When Draco was made a Death Eater and ordered to kill Albus Dumbledore as his first mission by Voldemort, Narcissa saw this suicide mission for what it was and went to Snape, who also knew Draco was being set up to fail, for help and got him to make an Unbreakable Vow to watch over Draco and take over if it seemed he would fail.<ref name="HBP"/> 

How she reacted to Snape being a double agent is unknown but it can be assumed she was sympathetic since she and Lucius had ceased to be loyal to Voldemort for similar reasons and the fact that he was the one who convinced Voldemort to free her husband from Azkaban and was the only Death Eater who continued to treat Lucius with respect after his loss of favour, something even her older sister didn't do.

===Kreacher===
[[File:Kreacher OotP SF.png|160px|thumb|left|[[Kreacher]]]]
Like most of the Blacks except Sirius, Narcissa was held in high esteem by Kreacher the House Elf. She in turn treated the attention starved house elf more kindly than her cousin did. This enabled her to learn about Harry's love for Sirius Black. Thus she was able to provide intel to Voldemort that led to the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. That battle caused many tragedies for Harry and the Malfoys: It led to the death of Sirius Black and Lucius's imprisonment and further loss of favour, which in turn led to Voldemort making Draco a Death Eater. It is unknown how Narcissa reacted to Kreacher accepting Harry as his master, if she ever learned of it, but she was probably sympathetic due to the fact she and her family, like her cousin Regulus Black, regretted being loyal to Voldemort.

==Etymology==
Unlike many others of the [[House of Black]], Narcissa does not appear to be named after a star or constellation.

*The name ''Narcissa'' is derived from [[Wikipedia:Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], a beautiful but vain character in Greek mythology from which the term ''[[Wikipedia:Narcissism|narcissism]]'', which refers to vanity and elitism, is derived. The name can also be derived from the flower by the same name, also known as [[Wikipedia:Daffodil|daffodil]]. The name of the plant may also be derived from the Greek word ''narkoa'', "to numb", referring to its narcotic properties. There is also a Slytherin connection to Narcissa's name due to its association with the Narcisse snake pits [http://www.amusingplanet.com/2014/01/narcisse-snake-pits-in-manitoba-canada.html].
*''Malfoy'' is derived from the French ''mal foi'' or ''mal foy'', meaning ''bad faith'' or ''unfaithful''.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:LEGO Narcissa.jpg|144px|thumb|Narcissa as a LEGO minifigure]]
*It was rumoured that the English actress {{wplink|Naomi Watts}} would portray Narcissa in {{HBP|FA}}. However, this was refuted by Watts' representatives. Before her death in 2009, Natasha Richardson was considered for the role, as well as Jennifer Saunders and Irish actress {{wplink|Alison Doody}}. Finally, in November 2007, it was announced that [[Helen McCrory]], who was originally cast as Bellatrix Lestrange in {{OOTP|FA}}, was cast as Narcissa Malfoy.
*[[J. K. Rowling]] stated that Narcissa Malfoy was not a Death Eater, but merely agreed with the philosophy of blood purity. Why she never became a Death Eater is unknown, but it is most likely this was because of her overwhelming love, loyalty and commitment to her family above anything else. 
**This is perhaps why, in {{LEGO|Y2}}, Narcissa is a character without the ability to perform dark magic, despite being described as a dark witch in the canon. 
*Despite not being a  full Death Eater she is shown taking orders from Lord Voldemort. She also likely joined her husband and other Death Eaters in humiliating muggles at the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], showing that she owns a set of Death Eater robes much like [[Fenrir Greyback]]. She also assisted Voldemort in luring Harry Potter into a trap through [[Kreacher]]'s information.
*Helen McCrory said, that in truth, Narcissa finds most of Bellatrix's behaviour pretty appalling and it is only through loyalty to her as well as Lucius and Draco, that she allows her to continue behaving in the way she does.
*In the novel version of {{HBP}}, it is Narcissa who asks [[Severus Snape]] to make the [[Unbreakable Vow]] to her, regarding the protection he has consented to give to her son, who has been by this time entrusted with the dangerous and difficult task of transporting some [[Death Eaters]] to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film version]] it is her sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] who suggests the vow in order to compromise Snape, rather than out of concern for Draco, while Narcissa seems not to even consider this while she is emotional.

*Also, in the book version of {{HBP}}, Narcissa has blonde hair. In the first promotional pictures of Helen on set, Narcissa has long blonde hair as well; but in the later pictures, and in the film versions of ''Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince'' she appears to have brown hair on top and blonde on the bottom; however, in both instalments of ''Deathly Hallows'', she appears to have mainly black hair with more visibly seen blonde/white ''streaks''. Her hair distinctly is a combination of the blonde hair characteristic of the Malfoy family and the dark hair characteristic of the Black family. This change in hair colour could also be seen to represent her growing disillusionment with both Voldemort as well as the Malfoy and Black families' traditional beliefs.[[File:12107854 10205438969673385 1833183363583131343 n.jpg|270x270px|thumb|Narcissa Malfoy concept art by Andrew Williamson]]
*In {{DH}}, Narcissa and Lucius run through the Battle of Hogwarts when the fighting began again, screaming for their son. They appeared in the Great Hall at the end of the Battle, though appearing unsure if they should be there. In the film, Narcissa grasped her son's hand and began to retreat across the bridge, not looking behind her and walking as fast as possible. Lucius ran after them a few moments later.
*When interviewed, Helen McCrory said that she had to film four different ending scenes for the Battle of Hogwarts in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2''.
*In the film version of The Skirmish at Malfoy Manor, Dobby [[Disarming Charm|disarms]] Narcissa by snapping his fingers.
*Although Dobby disarms Narcissa, he conveniently dropped the wand before he disapparates from Malfoy Manor, allowing Narcissa to recover it.
*In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Deathly Hallows: Part 2]]'', Narcissa is seen holding another wand. This wand is the subject of a continuity error. Originally, Narcissa was to retrieve [[Draco Malfoy|Draco's]] wand from [[Harry Potter]] when she checks him for signs of life in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. After Draco rejoins his family during the temporary ceasefire, his mother returns the wand to him. An alternate scene was to show Draco throwing Harry the wand when Harry leaps from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s arms, but this was not shown in the final cut of the film. Harry was shown to still have his wand after being carried back to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] by Hagrid. As such, the wand remains a continuity error, as both Harry, Narcissa and Draco are seen holding it in the same scene.
*In the books, Narcissa seems to be somewhat more emotional than her film counterpart; she is noticeably hysterical and distraught when begging Snape to make the Unbreakable Vow in the book, whereas in the film she is much more composed and only seems slightly teary.
*In a deleted (and non-released scene) from the ''Deathly Hallows Part 1'', as Snape arrives at Malfoy Manor, Voldemort informs him that Narcissa has been 'most hospitable', to which Narcissa replies 'my Lord is always welcome here'. This is the only known full line that Narcissa has in the script.
*In {{HM}}, one of the many event exclusive outfits was based on Narcissa Malfoy's outfit and hairstyle.
