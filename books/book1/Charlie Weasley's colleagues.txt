These '''colleagues of [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]]''' were [[Dragonologist]]s that worked with Charlie.<ref name="PS14"/><ref name="GOF19"/>

==Biography==
A rather cheery lot, in [[1992]], four of them helped to [[Flight|fly]] the [[Norwegian Ridgeback]] [[Norberta|Norbert]] to their [[Romanian Dragon Sanctuary]].<ref name="PS14">{{PS|B|14}}</ref> In [[1994]], about twenty or thirty of them helped bring the [[dragon]]s for the [[1994]] [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="GOF19">{{GOF|B|19}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The [[narrator]]'s dialogue on the PC version of the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{PS}} implies that Charlie himself came to Hogwarts to collect Norbert rather than sending his associates. Despite this, at least two figures on [[broomstick]]s are seen flying around the [[Astronomy Tower]], and the scene is too shadowy to distinguish any features of the people in question.
