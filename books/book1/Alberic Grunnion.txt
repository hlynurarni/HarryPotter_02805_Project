{{Quote|Ah, Alberic Grunnion — where would we be without his outstanding contribution to explosive dung?|[[George Weasley]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)}}
'''Alberic Grunnion''' ([[1803]]–[[1882]]) was a [[19th century|nineteenth century]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] inventor, who developed the [[Dungbomb]], a [[magic]]al stink bomb that gives off a putrid odour.<ref name="COSG"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Alberic Grunnion was born in [[1803]],<ref name="COSG"/> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. If he enrolled at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], he attended the school from around [[1814]] to [[1821]].

===Adulthood===
At some point in the [[19th century|nineteenth century]], Alberic Grunnion invented the [[Dungbomb]], a prank item that was still very popular among young British [[wizardkind|wizards]] by the [[1990s]].<ref name="COSG"/>

===Death and post-mortem===
He died in [[1882]], at the age of 79. By the early [[1990s]], he was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]]. His card was one of the first in [[Harry Potter]]'s collection, being among the ones he obtained on his [[Hogwarts Express|trip]] to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]].<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Grunnion's name could possibly be in recognition of ''Alberich,'' a powerful wizard from "Song of the Nibelungen." The poem is mythical, but was the basis for Wagner's Ring Cycle. In Wagner's version, Alberich makes a ring from gold that he has found and places a curse on it against its thief. Interestingly, one of the prizes given to a 'hero' of the Ring Cycle is an [[Invisibility cloak]].
