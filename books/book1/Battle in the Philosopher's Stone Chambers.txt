The '''skirmish in the [[Underground Chambers|Underground Chambers]]''' was a battle that took place on [[4 June]] [[1992]], during [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s attempt to use [[Quirinus Quirrell]] to steal the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. It was also Voldemort's second attempt on [[Harry Potter]]'s life.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

During Harry, Ron, and Hermione's time in the chambers they battled through a set of obstacles that most eleven-year-old children would find near impossible, but succeeded anyway.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref> In the last chamber, Harry defeated Voldemort and kept the stone safe, with Quirrell dying in the process.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>   

The battle in the chambers was a defining moment in the Trio's years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], as they realised that their lives were never going to be normal and that Lord Voldemort would always make sure no school year would ever be ordinary.

==History==
===Battle through the chambers===
====Fluffy {{c|Rubeus Hagrid's obstacle}}====
{{Dialogue a-b-c-b|Ron|What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school? If any dog needs exercise, that one does.|Hermione|You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?|Harry|The floor? I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.|No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It was obviously guarding something.|Harry, Ron and Hermione|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Fluffy Still PS.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Fluffy in the third floor chamber]]
[[Fluffy]] was a giant three-headed dog, and [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s contribution to the protections put in place for the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. In [[1992]], Quirinus Quirrell enchanted a [[harp]] to put Fluffy to sleep while he searched  for the Stone; when the music stopped, Fluffy awoke. [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] had to play a [[flute]] to put it back to sleep, before they were able to slip through the trap door Fluffy was guarding. Quirrell found out how to get past Fluffy earlier that year by enticing Hagrid into a card game, offering a [[dragon egg]] as the stake, and getting him drunk enough to disclose the secret of how to pacify the otherwise vicious dog.<ref name="PS16"/> After the Philosopher's Stone was destroyed, Hagrid released Fluffy into the [[Forbidden Forest]].<ref name="accio quote">http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-bluepeter.htm</ref>

====Devil's Snare {{c|Pomona Sprout's obstacle}}====
{{Dialogue a-b-a-c-a|Hermione|[[Devil's Snare]], Devil's Snare... What did [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] say? It likes the dark and the damp —|Harry|So light a fire!|Yes — of course — but there's no wood!|Ron|HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR ''NOT''?|Oh, right!|Harry, Ron and Hermione|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:BluebellFlames.jpg|thumb|Hermione scorching the Devil's Snare with the Bluebell Flames]]

The second obstacle within the Chambers was [[Pomona Sprout]]'s Devil's Snare, placed seemingly to soften a deadfall through the trapdoor guarded by [[Fluffy]]. However, as the Devil's Snare is known for strangling its victims to death, and increasing its force of constriction at signs of struggle, Hermione Granger just barely managed to save [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and herself from death by strangulation, by burning the plant with [[Bluebell Flames]].<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

====Winged keys {{c|Filius Flitwick's obstacle}}====
{{dialogue a-b|Hermione Granger|These birds... they can't be here just for decoration.|Harry Potter|They're not birds! They're keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean... Yes — look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!|Hermione Granger and Harry Potter when they entered the chamber of winged keys|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

The third of the Chambers contained several [[Broomstick|brooms]] and was filled with Winged Keys, provided by Professor [[Filius Flitwick]], which, at a distance, appeared to be birds. There was a locked door at the end of the room which was impervious to the [[Unlocking Charm]], and could only be opened by identifying and catching the one key among the "flock" that would fit the door's lock.<ref name="PS16"/>

[[File:Harry-Potter and the winged-keys PS.png|250px|thumb|left|Harry retrieves the right key]]

Ron Weasley cleverly deduced that  the key that would open the locked door must be an old one, to match the old lock on the door. The only old key was readily identifiable, as [[Quirinus Quirrell]] had just used it and bent one of its wings. As soon as [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and Hermione took off on brooms to catch the winged key, they rest of the keys scattered to make the correct one more difficult to identify again. Harry was, however, able to retrieve the necessary key, which was described as old-fashioned and silver, with bright blue wings, by employing his skills as a [[Seeker]].<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

====[[Chessboard Chamber|Human Chess Game]] {{c|Minerva McGonagall's obstacle}}====
{{Quote|That's chess! You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!|Ron bravely sacrificing himself on the Chess board|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Ron sacrifice.gif|250px|thumb|Ron sacrificing himself in the human chess game ]]

The fourth obstacle was [[Minerva McGonagall]]'s — a giant [[Wizard's Chess]] set. Ron took command of the game, with Harry, Hermione, and himself replacing certain pieces (a Black bishop, rook and knight respectively), to defeat the opposing team and be allowed to pass. In the end, Ron sacrificed himself to allow Harry to capture the opposing King.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref> At the [[End-of-Term Feast]], following the events of the attack, [[Albus Dumbledore]] awarded Ron fifty [[House points]] for winning "''the best played game of chess that [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] has seen these many years''".<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

====[[Quirinus Quirrell's second mountain troll|Mountain troll]] {{c|Quirinus Quirrell's obstacle}}====

{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione|Go on.|Harry|I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one, come on, I can't breathe.|Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

When Harry and Hermione arrived at the obstacle set in place by [[Quirinus Quirrell]] — a troll — they realised it was already out cold. It was later discovered that Trolls were Quirrell's specialty, which he had also used to create a diversion during the [[1991]] [[Hallowe'en feast]], in his [[Quirinus Quirrell's first mountain troll|first]] attempt at retrieving the Philosopher's Stone.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

====[[Philosopher's Stone Chambers|Potion riddle]] {{c|Severus Snape's obstacle}}====
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Hermione Granger|This isn't magic — it's logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.|Harry Potter|But so will we, won't we?|Of course not, everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple|Hermione and Harry discussing the Logic Chamber|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Potions_Riddle.png|thumb|left|250px|Harry and the Potion Riddle]]
Harry and Hermione next arrived at a [[Severus Snape]]'s [[potion]]s riddle. The obstacle wasn't magic but logic, a challenge that most wizards would never figure out, as they did not put much stock in logic. Hermione had no trouble deferring the riddle and figured out which potion would help them, but there was only a little bit left. So Harry drank [[Fire Protection Potion|it]] and Hermione drank another [[Fire Protection Potion|one]], which allowed her to leave the chamber safely. She wished Harry good luck and told him he would be alright. Harry went on to the final chamber alone.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

The [[potion riddle]] as follows:

<poem style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">
"Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,
One among us seven will let you move ahead,
Another will transport the drinker back instead,
Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.
Choose, unless you wish to stay here for evermore,
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;
Second, different are those who stand at either end,
But if you would move onwards neither is your friend;
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight."</poem>
Based on Hermione's deductions, from left to right, the potions lineup is:<ref name="PS16" />
#[[Poison]]
#[[Nettle wine]]
#[[Fire Protection Potion|Potion to move the drinker forward through black flames]]
#[[Poison]]
#[[Poison]]
#[[Nettle wine]]
#[[Fire Protection Potion|Potion to move the drinker backwards through purple flames]]
===Mirror of Erised {{c|Albus Dumbledore's obstacle}} and the attack===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Harry|You!|Quirrell|Me, I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter.|But I thought – Snape –|Severus? Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?|Harry Potter discovering Professor Quirrell in the seventh chamber|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:Quirrell and Harry by the Mirror of Erised.png|thumb|300x300px|Harry discovering Quirrell in the chamber]]
[[File:Harry sees himself with Philosopher's Stone in Mirror of Erised.gif|thumb|Harry seeing himself holding the stone in the Mirror of Erised]]

Harry, then arrived at the obstacle of [[Albus Dumbledore]] — the [[Mirror of Erised]]. Standing there was Quirinus Quirrell. Harry was shocked — he had expected Snape. Quirrell explained that he tried to kill Harry, while Snape tried to save him. He said that ''he'' let the [[Quirinus Quirrell's first mountain troll|troll]] in on [[Hallowe'en]]. He then tied up Harry and tried to figure out how to get the Stone. Voldemort told him to "''Use the boy"'' Quirrell summoned Harry to tell him what he saw in the Mirror. Harry lied and said it was himself winning the House Cup. An accomplished [[Legilimency|Legilimens]], Voldemort was not fooled and told Quirrell to allow him to speak to Harry. Quirrell unravelled his turban to reveal the red-eyed and [[snake]]-like face of Tom Marvolo Riddle.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

[[File:Skirmish in the Underground Chambers.jpg|thumb|left|Harry facing Quirrell/Voldemort in the chamber]]

After Harry's refusal to join the Dark Lord, Voldemort ordered Quirrell to kill him, but because of [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]]' [[Sacrificial protection|loving sacrifice]] ten years earlier, Quirrell couldn't touch him without experiencing debilitating levels of pain, and having his flesh burn. Around that moment, Harry fell unconscious due to his injuries and the pain in his scar. Voldemort left Quirrell's body and fled, abandoning his servant to die. After Voldemort fled, Albus Dumbledore descended into the chambers. After reaching the Philosopher Stone's chamber he found Harry unconscious and rushed to his aid. If Dumbledore had arrived any later Harry would have died.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref> 
===Aftermath===
====End of first year====
{{Dialogue a-b|Harry Potter|But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?|Albus Dumbledore|Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realise that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.|[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Harry Potter|Harry]] discussing the power of [[love]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

[[File:B1C17M2 Harry's first Hospital Wing stay.png|250px|thumb|Harry in the [[Hospital Wing]] after the attack]]

Three days later, Harry woke up in the hospital wing to find Dumbledore standing before him. Dumbledore explained that the Stone had been destroyed and [[Nicolas Flamel]] would die. He, then, explained the reason Voldemort, and by extension Quirrell, couldn't touch him.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

====1995-1996 school year====
{{Quote|Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher, there was just the minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.|[[Harry Potter]] telling Dolores Umbridge about the attack in the underground chambers|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

[[File:Hhmeeting.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dumbledore's Army brings up this battle]]

[[1995|Three years later]], while explaining all he'd done to Ron and Hermione, Harry mentioned the Battle in the Philosopher's Stone Chambers. He was later given detention by [[Dolores Umbridge]] for saying that Quirrell had been possessed by Voldemort.<ref name="OOTP15">{{OOTP|B|15}}</ref> Then, at the [[Hog's Head]], [[Neville Longbottom]] told everyone that Harry saved the Philosopher's Stone.<ref name="OOTP17">{{OOTP|B|17}}</ref> Then, while trying to come to the [[Department of Mysteries]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] brought up the fact that she was three years older than they were when they first fought Voldemort.<ref name="OOTP34">{{OOTP|B|34}}</ref>

====1996-1997 school year====
{{Quote|Quirrell was mediocre ''[...]'' |[[Severus Snape]]'s low opinion of Quirrell|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

[[File:Bellatrix_Lestrange_and_Severus_Snape.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] questions Snape in [[1996]]]]

[[1996|Four years after this battle]], at [[Spinner's End]], Bellatrix Lestrange maliciously reminded him that Snape himself had interfered in the events leading up to the Battle in the Philosopher's Stone Chambers. Snape replied that Quirrell was "mediocre", and that he had stopped him simply because he was "unworthy".<ref name="HBP2">{{HBP|B|2}}</ref>
