==History==
In [[1992]], following the killing of two of his roosters, [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] gamekeeper [[Rubeus Hagrid]] suspected that either a Blood-Sucking Bugbear or [[fox]]esÂ from the Forbidden Forest were responsible, implying such creatures inhabited the forest. [[Harry Potter]] caught Hagrid while he was on his way to ask [[Albus Dumbledore]] for permission to place a [[charm]] around the coop in order to protect the chickens from further attacks.<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref> However, as it turned out, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] had killed the chickens while she was possessed by [[Tom Riddle]].<ref name="COS17">{{COS|B|17}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The {{wplink|Bugbear}} is an imaginary creature historically used to frighten naughty children into behaving.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugbear Bugbear]" on Wikipedia</ref> Today, the term bugbear is used to describe something that is a source of dread, resentment, or irritation.<ref>"[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bugbear Bugbear]" on Wiktionary</ref>
*Given that bugbear is a regional term for what is also called a [[boggart]], it is possible that the Blood-Sucking Bugbear is a variety or relative of boggart. This may be why [[Newton Scamander]] does not cover the creature in the fifty-second edition of {{FB}} (as boggarts are [[non-being]]s).
