'''Professor<ref name="WWHP"/> Quentin Trimble'''<ref name="PS">{{PS|B|5}}</ref> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who once occupied the post of [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="WWHP"/> He authored the [[List of books|textbook]] ''[[The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection]]'', a required reading for any student enrolled in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Hogwarts subjects|class]].<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE}} (''The Paintings of Hogwarts'')</ref>

==Biography==
===Lifetime===
Quentin attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, and was later appointed to the position of [[Headmaster]] of the school.<ref name="WWHP"/> Sometime throughout his adulthood, Quentin (or, as he was known after his appointment as Headmaster, Professor Trimble) authored the book ''[[The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection]]'', a required reading for any [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] student.<ref name="PS"/><ref name="HPLE"/>

===Post-mortem===
[[File:Professor Quentin Trimble.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Professor Trimble's portrait in the [[Headmaster's office]]]]

Trimble was no longer the Headteacher when [[Armando Dippet]] took over in the early [[20th century]].<ref>{{TBB|R|F}} - Albus Dumbledore's notes</ref> In or prior to the end of the school term in [[1986]], Professor Trimble passed away, and a [[portrait]] was hung of him at the [[Headmaster's office]] in [[Hogwarts Castle]] so that he could offer advice and solace to future [[Headmaster]]s of the school.<ref name="WWHP"/> Unfortunately, whoever painted his name misspelled it, a mistake that was never fixed.<ref name="HPLE"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Trimble was very knowledgeable in how to defend oneself from the [[Dark Arts]], as he authored ''[[The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection]]'', an authoritative text in the subject. He had very good knowledge of defensive spells and [[Dark charm]]s and how to perform them, and was highly knowledgeable of various dark [[creature]]s, meaning he had likely experienced them himself.

==Etymology==
*"Trimble" is most likely a derivation of "tremble", meaning "to shake" - fitting considering his career as an author of books against the [[Dark Arts|dark forces]]. As the shaky [[Quirinus Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher in the year that [[Harry Potter]] purchased Trimble’s book, it is likely to be a reference to that.

==Behind the scenes==
*Professor Trimble's name is considered to be misspelled "Quintin Trimble" on his [[portrait]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]].<ref name="HPLE"/> But the truth is that Quintin is a variant of spelling. It may be a hint to the fact that he also was the 15th Hogwarts headmaster (15th is 'quindecim' in Latin).
