'''Minister Ulick Gamp'''<ref name="PM"/> was the first [[Minister for Magic]]. He held the office from [[1707]] to [[1718]].<ref name="PM"/> 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ulick Gamp likely was born sometime before [[1690]].

===Ministry career===
After graduating, he joined the [[Wizard's Council]] and became a member of [[Wizengamot]]. In 1707. after the abolishment of the Council, he bacame the first British Minister of Magic. Gamp had the onerous job of policing a fractious and frightened community adjusting to the imposition of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Statute of Secrecy]]. His greatest legacy was to found the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. During Gamp's term, the Ministry outlawed the use of the [[Cruciatus Curse|Cruciatus]], [[Imperius Curse|Imperius]] and [[Killing Curse]]s, dubbing them [[Unforgivable Curses|"unforgivable"]].<ref name="TBBR">{{TBB|R}} - Albus Dumbledore on ''Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump''</ref> During the early years of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]], when the fate of the popular wizarding pub The [[Leaky Cauldron]] was uncertain, Gamp agreed to bestow the landlord the responsibility of letting people into [[Diagon Alley]], being sensitive to the needs of the patrons. To honour Gamp’s protection of the pub, the landlord created a new brand of [[beer]] in his name, [[Gamp's Old Gregarious]].<ref name="leaky cauldron"/> In [[1707]], he was elected as the first [[Ministry of Magic]]. 

Gamp was elected Minister at least twice before resigning or being voted out of office in 1718.

===Legacy===
He was depicted in a portrait hung at the [[Prime Minister]]'s office at [[Prime Minister's office|10 Downing Street]] and, most likely, at the office of the [[Minister for Magic]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. It is highly probable that a [[Permanent Sticking Charm]] was placed on it, as the Muggle Prime Minister could never get the portrait off his wall, even with a builder to help. It served as a messenger between the [[Minister for Magic]] and the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Prime Minister]].<ref name="HBP1">{{HBP|B|1}}</ref>

There was also a portrait of Ulick Gamp at the [[Leaky Cauldron]],<ref name="FBC2.3">{{FBC|2|3}}</ref> presumably as an honour for ensuring protection of the pub as a safe haven for wizards.<ref name="leaky cauldron">{{WW|the-leaky-cauldron}}</ref> After a [[Mountain Troll|mountain troll]] that had been kept in [[Percival Shacklehorn]]'s [[Percival Shacklehorn's tent|charmed tent]] escaped and smashed much of the pub, the [[Leaky Cauldron bartender|bartender]] mistakenly hit the portrait with a [[Confundus Charm]]. The charred painting was subsequently retrieved and restored during the Ministry investigation that followed the disturbance, by [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner]].<ref name="FBC2.3">{{FBC|2|3}}</ref>
