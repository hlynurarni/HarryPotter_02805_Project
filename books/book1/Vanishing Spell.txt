The '''Vanishing Spell'''<ref name="OOTP15">{{OOTP|B|15}}</ref> (''Evanesco'')<ref name="OOTP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref> was a [[Transfiguration]] [[spell]] used to [[Vanishment|vanish]] both animate and inanimate objects "into non-being, which is to say, everything".<ref name="DH30">{{DH|B|30}}</ref>

==Nature==
The Vanishing Spell was one of the most complicated [[spell]]s taught at [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]].<ref name="OOTP13" />

It became more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be [[Vanishment|vanished]]; for instance, a [[snail]], as an invertebrate, was rather simple, whereas the [[mouse]], as a mammal, presented a great challenge.<ref name="OOTP15" /> The greatest challenge, however, was the [[vanishment]] of a [[Cat|kitten]], which [[Hermione Granger]] managed to do by [[1995|mid-year]].<ref name="OOTP16">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref>

[[Minerva McGonagall]] stated that Vanished objects go "''into non-being, which was to say, everything''".<ref name="HMy4ch3">{{HM|4|3|t}}</ref><ref name="DH30"/>

Certain objects could be [[Charm|enchanted]] to resist Vanishing Spells, such as fireworks. For example, [[Fred and George Weasley]] charmed their [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] fireworks so that if anyone attempted to Vanish them, not only would they remain but would multiply by ten each time.<ref name="OOTP28">{{OOTP|B|28}}</ref>

==History==
In "[[The Wizard and the Hopping Pot]]" from {{TBB}}, the son of the original owner of the pot tries to vanish the pot, but the spell had no effect.<ref name="TBB 1">{{TBB|R}} - "The Wizard and the Hopping Pot"</ref> Also in the story [[Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump]] in the same book, the witch [[Babbitty Rabbity]] successfully vanishes a hat.<ref name="TBB 2">{{TBB|R}} - Babbity Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump</ref>

During the [[1987–1988 school year]], this [[spell]] was taught to [[fourth year]]s in [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="HMy4ch3"/>

In [[1991]], [[Harry Potter]] may have used this spell [[Underage magic|unintentionally]] to make the glass at the [[Zoo]] disappear.<ref name="PS2">{{PS|B|2}}</ref>

In [[1992]], after being forced to take a photo with [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] for [[Colin Creevey]] and then asked to sign it, Harry wished he knew a good Vanishing Spell to escape the embarrassment.<ref name="CS6">{{COS|B|6}}</ref>

In [[May]] [[1993]], [[Neville Longbottom]] may have used this spell unintentionally during a [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] lesson, in which Professor McGonagall stated that all students would still be having their [[Second year exams|end of year exams]] in one week, despite the attacks on students and the suspension of [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. [[Neville Longbottom's first wand|Neville's wand]] slipped and one of the legs on his desk vanished after hearing the announcement.<ref name="CS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>

During the [[1995–1996 school year]], [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall]] introduced this spell in her very first Transfiguration class with the [[fifth year]] students, giving them a lecture and then setting them on vanishing [[snail]]s. This spell was referred to by McGonagall in its plural form when she introduced it, along with [[Conjuring Spells]].<ref name="OOTP13" />

When none of the students except [[Hermione Granger]] could perform the spell properly, Professor McGonagall told the students to practise the spell overnight, for a fresh start [[4 September|the next day]]. In their second lesson, the students were given questions on the Vanishing Spell for homework.<ref name="OOTP13" /> On [[6 September]], however, the students were given a break from this [[spell]] and instead were given a long and difficult essay on the [[Inanimatus Conjurus Spell]].<ref name="OOTP14">{{OOTP|B|14}}</ref>

Later on in the year, Professor McGonagall returned the class to Vanishing Spells, this time working to make [[Mouse|mice]] [[Vanishment|disappear]].<ref name="OOTP15" /> However, in the week leading up to the [[Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1995)|Gryffindor-Slytherin match]], she abstained from giving them homework so that the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] could practise.<ref name="OOTP19">{{OOTP|B|19}}</ref>
