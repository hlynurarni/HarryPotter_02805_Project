'''Alderton''' was a [[Muggle-born]] or [[half-blood]] wizard who was sent to [[Azkaban]] for "stealing [[magic]]" by the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] in [[1997]], while [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was in control of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. He told [[Dolores Umbridge]] and [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] that he was the son of [[Arkie Alderton]], who was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] known for designing [[broomstick]]s, but he was not believed. Alderton only stopped screaming desperately when he was threatened with the [[Dementor's Kiss]], but his ''"dry sobs echoed through the corridor"'' as he was dragged away to prison.<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref> He was likely released after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort's]] final defeat.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>
