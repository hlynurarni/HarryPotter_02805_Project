'''Libatius Borage''' was a [[South America]]n [[wizardkind|wizard]], widely considered "''one of the world's most famous [[potioneer]]s''".<ref name="PM">{{WW|castelobruxo}}</ref>

==Biography==
In his youth, he attended the [[wizarding school]] of [[Castelobruxo]], in [[Brazil]].<ref name="PM"/>

Among his many published works are ''[[Advanced Potion-Making]]'', ''[[Asiatic Anti-Venoms]]'' and ''[[Have Yourself a Fiesta in a Bottle!]]''<ref name="PM"/> — the first and second of which are used at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], as a textbook for [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level classes,<ref name="HBP9">{{HBP|B|9}}</ref> and as a reference text for [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]-level classes,<ref name="OP16">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref> respectively.

Despite Borage's accomplishments, [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Potions Master]] [[Severus Snape]] seemed to be more adept at [[Potions (class)|potion-making]] than even him, adding many footnotes to his own copy edition of Borage's book, significantly improving it.<ref name="HBP9"/>

During [[1980s]], Borage's portrait hung at the [[Hippogriff Clubhouse]].<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Libatius Borage's name probably derived from libation, a ritual offering of drink to the gods, and Borage, an edible herb believed to bestow excitement and courage in the hearts of those who consumed it.
