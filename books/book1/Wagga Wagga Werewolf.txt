}}The '''Wagga Wagga Werewolf''' was a [[werewolf]], likely from [[Wagga Wagga]] in New South Wales, [[Australia]].<ref name="COS10"/>

==Biography==
He was believed to have been vanquished by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] by means of the [[Homorphus Charm]], returning him to [[human]] form after letting out a piteous moan.<ref name="COS10">{{COS|B|10}}</ref> It was actually an [[Armenian warlock]] who performed this feat, though Lockhart used a [[Memory Charm]] on him and took all the credit for the werewolf’s defeat himself.<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>

This werewolf was likely the subject of Lockhart's book ''[[Wanderings with Werewolves]]'' and was discussed by Lockhart during a second-year class during his time as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Lockhart asked [[Harry Potter]] to reenact the "defeat" of the werewolf as part of a lecture, in which Harry only reluctantly agreed to participate in order to have Lockhart sign a permission form for him to get a [[Moste Potente Potions|library book]] from the [[Restricted Section]]. For a homework assignment, he asked students to compose a poem about the werewolf's defeat, and would give signed copies of ''[[Magical Me]]'' to the best writers.<ref name="COS10"/>
