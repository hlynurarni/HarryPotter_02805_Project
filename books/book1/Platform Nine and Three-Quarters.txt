{{Quote|Platform nine and three-quarters is the train platform from which students board the [[Hogwarts Express]], the scarlet steam engine that brings students to and from Hogwarts. It can be accessed by walking straight through the apparently solid barrier between platforms nine and ten.|Description of the platform's purpose and the means of entry|Pottermore}}
'''Platform Nine and Three-Quarters''' ('''Platform 9¾''') was a platform at [[King's Cross Station]] in [[London]]. Magically concealed behind the barrier between [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] Platforms [[Platform Nine|Nine]] and [[Platform Ten|Ten]], this Platform was where [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] students boarded the Hogwarts Express every [[1 September]], in order to attend school.<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

In order for someone to get onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, they had to walk directly at the apparently solid barrier dividing Platforms Nine and Ten.<ref name="PS6" /> When returning from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, there was a [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters station guard|guard]] stationed just outside the ticket barrier, in order to regulate exits from the platform through the gate, in order to not alarm the Muggles.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

==Overview==
In northwestern London lay [[King's Cross Station]], a Muggle railway station that was one of the busiest in the city. It was a perfectly ordinary station, with big plastic numbers over each track and guards who have never heard of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]].<ref name="PS6" /> However, every 1 September, as the clock overhead approaches eleven o’clock,<ref name="COS5">{{COS|B|5}}</ref> and the [[InterCity 125]] pulls into platform nine.<ref name="POA5">{{POA|B|5}}</ref> a strange crowd turned the occasional [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] head. The crowd was [[wizardkind|wizarding]] children, bearing enormous trunks and caged [[owl]]s and other unusual pets, making their way toward — and then through — the solid metal barrier between platforms nine and ten.<ref name="OOTP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref>

Through this barrier, of course, lay Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, home of the famous [[Hogwarts Express]]. There, a look back at the barrier revealed it is instead a wrought-iron archway with the words “Platform Nine and Three-Quarters” on it. Over the scarlet steam train's billowing smoke, there was a sign announcing that the Hogwarts Express would depart at eleven o’clock.<ref name="PS6" /> The platform also had a distinct smell — one which lifted the spirits of young wizards who, like [[Harry Potter]], look forward each summer to the start of term.<ref name="OOTP10"/>

Though the platform was normally only used six days a year (round trips for the beginning and end of term, as well as the [[Christmas]] and [[Easter|Easter holidays]]), the platform on those days was awash with activity. Steam from the scarlet engine flooded the platform as [[cat]]s wound their way around the wizards’ legs and [[owl]]s hooted to each other,<ref name="PS6" /> as hoardes of students and parents moved around through the steam “like dark ghosts”,<ref name="GOF11"/> their voices carrying through the mist.<ref name="DHE">{{DH|B|E}}</ref>

Finally, at 11:00, a whistle sounded announcing the train’s departure.<ref name="PS6" />, and the hiss of the pistons filled the platform as the train began to move,<ref name="GOF11">{{GOF|B|11}}</ref> creaking out of the station as family members stood on the platform and waved their children off to school.<ref name="OOTP10"/> Nobody returned to the platform, then, for months — until the end of term, when it once again filled with [[Wizardkind|wizards]] and a [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters station guard|wizened old guard]] sat by the archway back to the [[Muggle world]], making sure everyone got home without attracting too much attention.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

==History==

===Early history {{Comment|1850s-1971}}===
[[File:Tumblr m2v0ld1i5m1qg1krko6 250.gif|234x234px|thumb|left|The concealed entrance to Platform 9¾]]

The brainchild of [[Minister for Magic|Minister]] [[Evangeline Orpington]] in the [[1850s]], Platform Nine and Three-Quarters was the first of the concealed wizarding platforms at [[King's Cross Station|King's Cross]].<ref name="kingscrossstation">{{WW|kings-cross-station}}</ref>

After the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] had [[Ministry of Magic operation to acquire the Hogwarts Express|acquired]] the [[Hogwarts Express]], under Minister [[Ottaline Gambol]] in [[1830]]<ref name="Act1Scene11">{{CC|B|1|11}}</ref>, they also built a [[Hogsmeade station|railway station]] at [[Hogsmeade]], as a necessary adjunct to the train.<ref name="hogwartsexpress">{{WW|the-hogwarts-express}}</ref> The Ministry, however, refrained from building a station in the middle of [[London]], as that would stretch even the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]' notorious determination not to notice magic when it was exploding in front of their faces. It was only after Minister Orpington was appointed to the office ([[1849]]-[[1855]]) that a solution was reached: a concealed platform would be added to the newly Muggle-built King's Cross Station, accessible only to [[wizardkind|witches and wizards]].<ref name="kingscrossstation" /> There is no information on how exactly [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students were travelling during the period after the acquisition of the [[Hogwarts Express]] and the creation of the [[Hogsmeade station]] and before the creation of Platform 9¾ in the [[1850s]].

While the solution proved a good one, there were always some minor issues, such as witches and wizards dropping suitcases full of biting spellbooks or [[newt]] spleens all over the polished station floor, or disappearing through the solid barrier a little too loudly. To prevent any serious breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]], there is usually a number of plain-clothed Ministry of Magic employees on hand at the station, to deal with any inconvenient Muggle memories that may need [[Memory Charm|altering]].<ref name="kingscrossstation" />

On [[1 September]] [[1971]], [[Eileen Prince|Eileen Snape]] took her eleven-year-old son, [[Severus Snape]], to board the [[Hogwarts Express]] via this Platform. Muggles [[Evans sisters' father|Mr]] and [[Evans sisters' mother|Mrs Evans]] also took their witch daughter, [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], there along with her Muggle sister, [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia]]. While the parents looked around the platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, the two sisters argued and Petunia called her sister a freak.<ref name="DH33">{{DH|B|33}}</ref>

===Later history {{Comment|1991-2017}}===
{{Quote|Don't talk rubbish. There is no platform nine and three-quarters.|Muggle [[Vernon Dursley]]'s disbelief at the platform|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}[[File:Platform ten.png|251x251px|thumb|Harry Potter trying to find the platform while in a crowd of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s]]
[[Harry Potter]] first used Platform 9¾ on [[1 September]] [[1991]]. Not knowing how to get into it, and recognising the [[Weasley family]] as a family of [[wizardkind|wizards]], he asked [[Molly Weasley]] how to access it. As Harry crossed the Platform, he passed by a [[Neville Longbottom|round-faced boy]] telling his [[Augusta Longbottom|grandmother]] he had lost his [[Trevor|toad]], and a [[Lee Jordan|boy with dreadlocks]] showing a [[Lee Jordan's tarantula|tarantula]] to his peers.<ref name="PS6" />

In [[June]] [[1992]], at the end of the school year, Harry and his classmates returned to their homes via the Platform. Harry was picked up by [[Vernon Dursley]].<ref name="PS17" />

[[File:Blocked Barrier GIF.gif|245x245px|thumb|left|Harry Potter and Ron Weasley attempt to cross the magical barrier to Platform 9¾ in 1992, only to find it [[Blocked Barrier|blocked]]]]

On 1 September [[1992]], [[Dobby]] the [[House-elf]] blocked the magical barrier dividing Platforms Nine and Ten in order to prevent Harry Potter and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] from attending school. Consequently, they decided the only way to get to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] was to steal [[Arthur Weasley]]'s [[Flying Ford Anglia]] and fly it to the school.<ref name="COS5"/> When the school year ended, the students returned to the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world via the magical gateway in the platform.<ref name="CS18">{{COS|B|18}}</ref>

In [[1993]], the Weasleys took Harry to the Platform again. Arthur Weasley hoped to talk to Harry about [[Sirius Black]], but Harry had already overheard Arthur talking about it to his wife.<ref name="POA5"/> Once the school year ended, Harry and his classmates returned to the Platform, where he told [[Vernon Dursley]] about his godfather, "''a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run''".<ref name="PA22">{{POA|B|22}}</ref>

On 1 September [[1994]], the Weasleys and Harry travelled to [[King's Cross Station]] via [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] taxis.<ref name="GOF11"/>

Once the [[Hogwarts Express]] arrived at Platform 9¾ in June [[1995]], Harry Potter gave his [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard]] earnings to [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]], before crossing the magical barrier and being picked up by Vernon Dursley.<ref name="GF37">{{GOF|B|37}}</ref>

In [[1995]], the Weasleys, [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Remus Lupin]], [[Alastor Moody]], and Sirius Black (in his [[Animagus]] form) took Harry to King's Cross Station on foot, as they had been staying at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] in the [[London Borough of Islington|Borough of Islington]].<ref name="OP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref> When Harry arrived at the station at the end of the school year in June [[1996]], he was joined by Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Remus Lupin, Mr and Mrs Weasley, and Fred and George Weasley. The wizard group proceeded to threaten the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] that if Harry was mistreated in any way, one of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] would be sent along.<ref name="OP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

[[File:Tumblr_lv62gpY8jN1qb9qh4o3_r1_250.gif|225x225px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]] and his son [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus Potter]] crossing the barrier in 2017]]

Harry and the Weasleys returned to the Platform on 1 September 1996, where they were joined by two grim-faced, bearded [[Auror]]s in dark [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] suits, for Harry's protection. On the platform, Harry had a quick word with [[Arthur Weasley]] about his suspicions that [[Draco Malfoy]] was now a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]].<ref name="HBP7">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>

On 1 September [[2017]], Harry Potter took his sons ([[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]] and [[James Potter II|James Sirius]]) to King's Cross along with his wife [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]] and their youngest child and only daughter, [[Lily Potter|Lily Luna]]. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione Weasley]] also did so, as did Draco and [[Astoria Malfoy]]. There were also many other families, such as several of the other Weasleys.<ref name="DHE"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the books, the barrier that leads to the platform is described as being made of metal. In the films, however, the barrier is a brick wall.
*People visited King's Cross station and took so many pictures of platforms nine and ten that eventually the station master had a cart put halfway through the wall, which is now a small tourist attraction.
*There were also a lot of injuries of people running headfirst into the wall.
*In the [[Brazil]]ian translation, the platform is called ''Plataforma Nove e Meia'' - ''Platform Nine and a Half'', instead of ''Platform Nine and Three-Quarters''. In the films, however, the platform is called ''Plataforma Nove e Três Quartos''<ref>''Harry Potter'' series (Brazilian edition)</ref>.[[File:29023742261 f58c374388 o.jpg|220x220px|thumb|The wall used as Platform 9¾ in the films, taken in 2016]]
*In the film adaptions the Platform 9¾ scenes were filmed between platforms 4 and 5 at Kings Cross station in London.<ref>[https://www.pottermore.com/features/behind-the-scenes-platform-nine-and-three-quarters Behind the scenes: Platform nine and three-quarters] at {{PM}}</ref> A fake replica cover was used to cover the original wall to increase its width and prevent damage to the Victorian structure from the impact of the luggage trolley.

===Author's comments===
"''In choosing the number of the concealed platform that would take young witches and wizards to boarding school, I decided that it would have to be a number between those of the Muggle platforms - therefore, it was clearly a fraction.''

''The number nine and three-quarters presented itself without much conscious thought, and I liked it so much that I took it at once. It is the 'three-quarters' that makes it, of course.''"
