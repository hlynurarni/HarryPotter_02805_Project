A host of '''waiters''' served food at the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]] on [[1 August]], [[1997]] at [[the Burrow]].

==History==
They wore white robes and arrived at two o'clock; while guests were arriving, they sat with the [[Band at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding|band]] under a tree close to the main tent, smoking pipes. After the vows were completed and the reception began, the waiters filled the tent and carried silver trays of [[Pumpkin Juice|Pumpkin juice]], [[Butterbeer]], and [[Firewhisky]], others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.<ref name="DH8">{{DH|B|8}}</ref>

When the reception was [[Attack at the Burrow|attacked]] by [[Death Eaters]] that evening following the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|fall]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], the waiters presumably fled, along with most of the guests.<ref name="DH9">{{DH|B|9}}</ref>
