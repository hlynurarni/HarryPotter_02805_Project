Phyllida Spore lived in the [[15th century]].<ref name="1408portrait" /> She studied [[Herbology]], writing ''[[One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi]]'', a textbook that was still used at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="ps5" /><ref name="hbp25">{{HBP|B|25}}</ref> 

Spore became the [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of Hogwarts during her lifetime.<ref name="GFf21" /> At some point, she also earned the title "Dame,"<ref name="dameportrait" /> the female equivalent of the honour of [[knight]]hood in [[Great Britain]].<ref name="damewiki">"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_%28title%29 Dame (title)]" on Wikipedia</ref>

Professor Spore died sometime in or before [[1995]].<ref name="DOD" /> Two [[portrait]]s of her hung at Hogwarts: one painted in [[1408]] depicted a middle aged woman,<ref name="1408portrait" /> and another, hung in the [[Headmaster's office]],<ref name="GFf21" /> depicted her as a younger witch with long dark hair sitting in a chair with skull-shaped finials.<ref name="dameportrait" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s:''' As Headmistress of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Professor Spore was an accomplished witch with sufficient skills in [[Defensive Charm]]s and [[protective enchantment]]s to control and maintain those surrounding [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. 
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Phylida was a very skilled and knowledgeable [[Herbologist]], having thorough knowledge of ''One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi'' and having written several books about the subject.
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': One of her books (''[[Healing at Home with Herbs]]'') specialised on the healing properties of such herbs, showing she also had good knowledge of healing [[magic]]. 

==Behind the scenes==
*Phyllida's portrait at the [[Headmaster's office]] appears only in {{GOF|FA}}. In {{COS|FA}} a large painting of [[Antonia Creaseworthy]] occupies that space, and in {{OOTP|FA}} and {{HBP|FA}} the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] is hung there.
*The portrait of Spore that is featured in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'' was based on an [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning_by_Michele_Gordigiani_1858.jpg 1858 portrait of poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806–1861)], by Michele Gordigiani.

==Etymology==
Her first name is from Greek for "leaf" or "plant." A spore is a body produced by fungi, algae and non-flowering plants that is very protective and resistant to drought.
