This '''[[Wizardkind|witch]]''' was a the mother of the [[Montgomery sisters]] and their [[Montgomery|younger brother]]. When she refused to help the [[Death Eaters]] in [[1997]] and support their [[Pure-blood supremacy|cause]], her then five-year-old son was attacked by the bloodthirsty [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]], on the Death Eaters' orders. The boy later died in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] from his injuries, as the [[Healer]]s there were unable to save his life given the grave extent of his injuries.<ref name="HBP22">{{HBP|B|22}}</ref>
