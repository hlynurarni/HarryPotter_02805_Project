{{Quote|It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite grey, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.|[[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]] witness a [[Troll]] for their first time on [[Hallowe'en]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

'''Quirinus Quirrell's first mountain troll''' was a male [[mountain troll]] brought into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[31 October]] ([[Hallowe'en]]) [[1991]], by [[Quirinus Quirrell]], then possessed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], in an attempt to steal the [[Philosopher's Stone]] of [[Nicolas Flamel]].<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

Quirinus Quirrell was able to control this troll, a rare talent. He said later that he had a gift with trolls.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref> He also used a [[Quirinus Quirrell's second mountain troll|troll to help protect the Philosopher's Stone]].<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

==History==
===Background===
{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione|You're saying it wrong. It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the gar nice and long.|Ron|You do it, then, if you're so clever|Hermione and Ron arguing during Charms class|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}[[File:PS_Wingardium_Leviosa_feather.gif|219x219px|thumb|Hermione Granger mastering ''Wingardium Leviosa'']]
On [[31 October]] ([[Hallowe'en]]) [[1991]], the [[first year]] [[Charms (class)|Charms]] class were taught how to perform the [[Levitation Charm]] (''Wingardium Leviosa''), by [[Professor]] [[Filius Flitwick]]. All the students in the class struggled with its pronunciation, apart from [[Hermione Granger]], who lectured Ron Weasley on his incorrect casting and cast it perfectly herself, much to Flitwick's delight.<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

After class, a particularly annoyed Ron insulted [[Hermione Granger]] to his friend [[Harry Potter]], by remarking that she was a "nightmare" had no friends, due to her bossy and boastful nature. Hermione overheard this, and she was later seen crying in the [[First-Floor Girls' Toilets|girls' bathroom]] by [[Parvati Patil]], while [[Neville Longbottom]] reported this to an unknowing Harry and Ron.<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

===The Hallowe'en Feast===
{{Quote|Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.|Quirrell distracting Hogwarts school|Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone}}[[File:Troll in the Dungeons!.jpg|246x246px|thumb|Quirrell "warning" Hogwarts about the troll]]
As the students were attending the [[Hallowe'en Feast]], Professor Quirrell suddenly sprinted into the [[Great Hall]] frantically, with a terrified expression, over to the teacher's table, warning [[Albus Dumbledore]] of a troll that had been let into the [[dungeons]], before collapsing on the floor.<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

The whole student body then began to panic in an uproar, with [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] having to first silence them all with [[Purple Firecrackers]], before telling the [[Prefect]]s to take the students back to their dormitories and for all teachers to follow him to the dungeon, to deal with the loose troll. During the walk back to the [[Gryffindor Common Room]], [[Harry Potter]] remembered Hermione was unaware of this, and he and Ron subsequently went to rescue Hermione.<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

===Attack in the Girls' Bathroom===
{{Quote|Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out [[Ronald Weasley's first wand|his own wand]] -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!" The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.|Ron having defeated the Troll with the Levitation Charm|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}[[File:Harry-potter1-harry_ron_troll.jpg|238x238px|thumb|Ron and Harry after having defeated a fully grown Mountain troll]]
Harry and Ron ran toward the bathroom and spotted [[Severus Snape]], following Quirrell to the [[Hogwarts Castle|third floor corridor]]. They then noticed the troll lurking about the corridor, and unknowingly, locked the troll in the girls bathroom with Hermione. Realising their mistake, they ran in to rescue a terrified Hermione, with Ron throwing a metal pipe at it, which only aggravated it, along with all the shouting. Harry, meanwhile, jumped on the troll and shoved [[Harry Potter's wand|his wand]] up its nose in an attempt to stop it. This caused the troll to howl in pain, and it began to swing its club. With Harry's life in danger, Ron ingeniously thought of the first [[spell]] that came to his head, the [[Levitation Charm]], which he had learnt earlier that day, and cast it to [[Levitation|levitate]] the troll's club. He then dropped the club on top of its head, knocking it out instantly and causing it to fall to the ground incapacitated.<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
{{Quote|Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.|McGonagall rewarding Ron and Harry for having defeated the troll|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}[[File:Professors ps.jpg|245x245px|thumb|The Professors witnessing the aftermath]]
After the troll fell the floor, Harry observed that it was only knocked out, not dead. Harry extracted his wand from the troll's nostrils, with it being covered in [[Troll bogeys]], much to his disgust. Then, [[Professor]]s [[Minerva McGonagall]], Snape and Quirrell entered the bathroom to witness the aftermath of the pandemonium. A horrified McGonagall questioned the boys as to what they were doing going after a fully grown mountain troll, but Hermione lied to McGonagall, claiming she had sought the troll out herself. McGonagall then lectured the three [[first year]]s on their recklessness, then deducted five points from [[Gryffindor]] from Hermione for being foolish, before both giving Ron and Harry five each for having defeated the troll, before sending them away to the [[Gryffindor Common Room]]. Afterwards, Harry, Ron and Hermione became best friends, forming the "[[Trio]]".<ref name="PS10">{{PS|B|10}}</ref>

{{Dialogue a-b|Harry|You let the troll in?|Quirrell|Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls,  -- you must have seen what I did to the [[Quirinus Quirrell's second mountain troll|one]] in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that [[Fluffy|three-headed dog]] didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly|Quirrell revealing his deception to Harry Potter in the [[Underground Chambers]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Harry, Ron, and Hermione originally assumed that Snape was behind the "troll business", but Harry, trying to stop Voldemort in his attempt to steal the [[Philosopher's Stone]], found out that it was Quirrell, not Snape, who had let the troll in.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Screenshot 931.png|thumb|The Troll as depicted in the console versions of {{PS|G}}]]
*In the PS1 and PC versions of {{PS|G}}, when dealing with the troll, Harry must cast the [[Knockback Jinx]] to destroy pieces of debris the troll throws at him, while Ron [[charm]]s the club with the [[Levitation Charm]]. In the PS2 version, the troll must be defeated the [[Softening Charm]], by having the troll hit enchanted Spongify tiles, which will cause its club to bounce back and strike it head, which must be done five times to knock it out. There is also a major plot difference in the game, where they rescue Hermione from the second-floor girls bathroom when it should be the [[First-Floor Girls' Toilets|first floor]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref>
