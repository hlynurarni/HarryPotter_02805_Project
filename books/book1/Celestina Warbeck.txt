'''Madam Celestina Warbeck''' (b. [[18 August]],<ref name="Pottermore" /> [[1917]]<ref name="FWC" />) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and popular singer known as "''The Singing Sorceress''". She attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]]. She was often featured on the show called [[Witching Hour]], which runs on the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]].<ref name="CoS">{{COS}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Celestina Warbeck was born on [[18 August]],<ref name="Pottermore" /> [[1917]]<ref name="FWC" /> in [[Wales]] to a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] father and a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] mother. Her father, a minor functionary in the [[Muggle Liaison Office]], met her mother, a failed actress, when the latter was attacked by a [[Lethifold]] disguised as a stage curtain.<ref name="Pottermore" />

Celestina's musical talent was apparent even at an early age; in [[1927]], the wizarding magazine [[Spellbound (magazine)|''Spellbound'']] published an article about her talents when she was around ten years old, referring her as a child prodigy.<ref name="COG">{{COG}} {{See image|File:Spellbound magazine.png}}</ref>

Disappointed to learn that there was no such thing as a wizarding stage school, [[Celestina Warbeck's mother|Mrs Warbeck]] reluctantly let her daughter go to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] (which she attended from [[1928]]-[[1936]] and was Sorted into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]), but frequently bombarded the school with letters to form a theatre club, choir and [[tap-dancing|dancing]] class to showcase her daughter's innumerable talents.<ref name="Pottermore" />

===Career as a singer===
Frequently appearing with a chorus of backing [[banshee]]s, Celestina's concerts were justly famous. Three devoted fans were involved in a three-broom pile-up over [[Liverpool]] on the last night of her '[[Flighty Aphrodite]]' tour.<ref name="Pottermore" /> Her tickets often went on sale in the black market for vastly inflated prices (one reason why [[Molly Weasley]], who listened to her songs every [[Christmas]],<ref name="HBP16">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref> could never see her favourite singer live).<ref name="Pottermore" />

Celestina's personal life provided much fodder for the gossip columns of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. Warbeck became romantically involved with one of her backing dancers early in her career. They married, but ended up divorcing after only a year. Some time later, she married her [[Celestina Warbeck's second husband|manager]], and they had a [[Celestina Warbeck's son|son]] together. However, after ten years of marriage, Warbeck left him in order to marry [[Irving Warble]], a music composer.<ref name="Pottermore" />

Celestina sometimes lent her name and talents to good causes, such as raising funds for [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] with a recording of [[Puddlemere United]]'s anthem ''Beat Back Those Bludgers, Boys, and Chuck That Quaffle Here''.<ref name="DPN">''[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]''</ref><ref name="Pottermore" /> More controversially, Celestina was vocal in her disagreement when the [[Ministry of Magic]] sought to impose restrictions on how the wizarding community was allowed to celebrate [[Hallowe'en]].<ref name="QTtA">{{QTA|R}}</ref>

Some of Celestina's best-known songs include ''[[You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me]]'' and ''A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love''. Her fans are usually older people who love her grandstanding style and powerful voice.<ref name="Pottermore" /> The late 20th-century album ''You Stole My Cauldron but You Can't Have My Heart ''was a massive global hit. She also featured heavily on shows at the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]], one such being the ''[[Witching Hour]]'' hosted by [[Glenda Chittock]].<ref name="CoS" />

In [[2003]] she allowed a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[dog]]-walker who accidentally took a [[Portkey]] to one of her concerts to join her on the stage for a duet of ''[[A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love]]''; while the [[Memory Charm]] cast on him by a harassed [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] official appeared at first to have erased his memory of the incident, he since has written a popular song that greatly resembles Warbeck's hit, something she was not amused about.<ref name="Portkey">{{WW|portkeys}}</ref>

In the summer of [[2014]], Celestina Warbeck travelled to the [[Patagonian Desert]] to watch the games of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]]. Her presence, alongside other wizarding celebrities, was noted by reporter [[Rita Skeeter]] to have caused "''flurries of excitement''", with crowd members scrambling for autographs and even attempting to cast [[Bridging Charm]]s to reach the VIP boxes.<ref name="PottermoreDP">{{PM}} - [[DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL|DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY REUNITES AT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP FINAL" (Daily Prophet, 08 July 2014)]]</ref>

Celestina's latest album was entitled ''[[You Stole My Cauldron But You Can't Have My Heart]]''. The promotional tour included a show in [[Liverpool]]; fans desperate to arrive at this concert were involved in a three-broom crash.<ref name="DPN" /><ref name="Pottermore" />

Warbeck scheduled concerts in [[Exmoor Quidditch Stadium|Exmoor]], sponsored by [[The Sorcerer's Saucepot]]. Tickets were on sale for five [[Wizarding currency|Galleons]] each, and fans had to book their [[Portkey]]s early.<ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': In her free time, Celestina enjoyed breeding [[crup]]s, meaning she had a level of talent in the handling of [[magic]]al creatures.<ref name="hobbies">{{PM}} (2014) - Excerpt here: [https://www.today.com/popculture/j-k-rowling-writes-new-harry-potter-story-about-singing-1D80069158 Read J.K. Rowling's new Harry Potter story about a singing sorceress] - "Hobbies: Travelling in fabulous style, breeding rough-coated Crups, relaxing in any of her eight homes"</ref>
*'''Singing skills''': Celestina was a highly popular and talented vocalist, having had a very lucrative career as a pop singer with an impressive discography, along with a huge fan base throughout the [[wizarding world]], proving her abilities as a singer to have been quite legendary.

The lyrics also contain never-before-revealed information about Celestina's wand, written by [[J. K.

*Warbeck is Rowling's favourite off-stage character; the author imagined her to look and act like [[wikipedia:Shirley Bassey|Shirley Bassey]].<ref name="Pottermore" /> Rowling took the name "Celestina" from a friend with whom she had worked at Amnesty International in London many years, stating that the name was simply begging to be attached to a glamorous witch.<ref name="Pottermore" />
*On {{PM}}, new information about Celestina was revealed on [[18 August]] [[2014]], Celestina's 97th birthday.

===Author's comments===
"''Celestina is one of my favourite 'off-stage' characters in the whole series, and has been part of the Potter world ever since its inception, making an early appearance in the short-lived 'Daily Prophet' series I produced for members of the equally short-lived fan club run by my British publisher, Bloomsbury. Although we never lay eyes on Celestina during the whole seven volumes of the Potter books, I always imagined her to resemble Shirley Bassey in both looks and style. I stole her first name from a friend with whom I worked, years ago, at Amnesty International's Headquarters in London; 'Celestina' was simply begging to be scooped up and attached to a glamorous witch.''"
