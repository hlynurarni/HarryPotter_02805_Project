'''Davey Gudgeon''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1970s]]. He got his face scarred and almost lost his eye trying to get close enough to the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] to touch its trunk. For their own safety (and possibly the Willow's as well), students were forbidden to go near the tree since that event occurred.<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that Davey sustained other injuries, because it is never mentioned that Davey ''did'' lose an eyeball.
