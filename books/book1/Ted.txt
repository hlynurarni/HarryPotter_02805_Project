{{Quote|Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?''"<br />"''Well, Ted, I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as [[Kent]], [[Yorkshire]], and [[Dundee]] have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating [[Bonfire Night]] early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.|Ted and [[Jim McGuffin]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}

Following the downfall of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], he reported on the unusual amount of [[owl]] activity during the day as messages were passed throughout the [[Wizarding world]], while being unaware that the activity was a result of the [[Fall of Lord Voldemort celebrations|celebrations of Lord Voldemort's apparent demise]].<ref name="PS1" />
