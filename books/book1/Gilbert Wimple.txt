==Biography==
Gilbert Wimple was born well before [[1994]], possibly in [[Great Britain]]. He eventually received an education in [[magic]] and worked for the [[Committee on Experimental Charms]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Presumably as a result of working on the Committee, he acquired horns. Wimple attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]. [[Arthur Weasley]] pointed him out to [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]].<ref>{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Gilbert" means "bright pledge", derived from the Germanic elements gisil "pledge, hostage" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it was common during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was borne by a 12th-century British saint, the founder of the religious order known as the Gilbertines.
