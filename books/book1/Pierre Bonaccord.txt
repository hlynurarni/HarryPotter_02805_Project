'''Pierre Bonaccord''' was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the first [[Supreme Mugwump]] of the [[International Confederation of Wizards]].<ref name="OOTP31"/>

==Biography==
Bonaccord wanted to ban troll-hunting and grant rights to [[troll]]s, possibly granting them full "[[being]]" status as opposed to them being classified as "[[beast]]s". However, a tribe of [[Mountain Troll]]s had been causing a lot of trouble in [[Liechtenstein]], so their [[Wizarding world|wizarding community]] contested Bonaccord's appointment, and refused to join the Confederation as a result.<ref name="OOTP31">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*"Pierre" is a French form of ''Peter''. This name was also borne by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), a French impressionist painter, and by Pierre Curie (1859-1906), a physicist who discovered radioactivity with his wife Marie.
*A "bon-accord" is an expression or token of good will.
