'''Professor Cuthbert'''<ref>[https://images.ctfassets.net/bxd3o8b291gf/4hTuAQu13WcWEgOc6aO4AE/ec67068576a59da6e0a2466e52658517/CuthbertBinns_PM_B2C9M1_CuthbertBinnsTeachingAboutTheChamberOfSecrets_Moment.jpg Image url] of https://www.pottermore.com/image/the-legend-of-the-chamber-of-secrets - "CuthbertBinns_PM_B2C9M1_CuthbertBinnsTeachingAboutTheChamberOfSecrets_Moment.jpg"</ref> '''Binns''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[History of Magic]] [[professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He owned [[Cuthbert Binns's office|an office]] in [[Hogwarts Castle|the main castle]] and [[History of Magic Classroom|Classroom 4F]] on the [[Hogwarts Castle#First floor|first floor]] to teach in. He taught until a very old age, when he fell asleep in the [[staffroom|staff room]] and died in slumber.<ref name="PS8"/> Afterwards, he became a [[ghost]] who continued to teach, droning on about various [[Goblin Rebellions]] and [[Giant wars]] to bored, sleeping students.

Professor Binns's lessons were regarded as some of the most boring at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and only once in known history did he talk about something not strictly factual. During the [[1991–1992 school year]], he taught his [[first year]] students about numerous historical personalities such as [[Uric the Oddball]] and [[Emeric the Evil]], whom the class always got confused with.<ref name="PS8"/> The following [[1992–1993 school year|academic year]], he relayed the legend of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] to his [[second year]] class, but only after every student in the class showed complete and utter interest, despite initially stating the legend of the Chamber to be unimportant.<ref name="COS9"/> He continued to teach [[Harry Potter]] and his class for three further years, until most, if not every one of his students dropped [[History of Magic]] after completing their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|You're welcome. As my father always used to say, zzzzzz...|Cuthbert Binns to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)}}Cuthbert was born into the [[Binns family]], with [[Cuthbert Binns's father|Mr Binns]] as his father. It was said that his father always used to say something to him, but Cuthbert fell asleep in the middle of his sentence before he could say what it was.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}} - GBC version</ref>

===Career at Hogwarts===
====Earlier years====
{{Quote|Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming round long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again.|Description.|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}Cuthbert came to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and applied for the post of [[Professor]] of [[History of Magic]], which he was granted. Cuthbert - now known as Professor Binns - was given [[History of Magic Classroom|Classroom 4F]] on the first floor near a mossy courtyard to teach in, as well as [[Cuthbert Binns's office|an office]] in the fifth-floor corridor.

His lessons were known to be the most boring in all of Hogwarts; he read from his never-ending collection of notes. His students, whom he never payed any attention to, would fall asleep listening to his droning, reedy voice, eventually waking up to copy down a name or date, but falling asleep again.<ref name="COS9"/>

====Later years and death====
{{Quote|Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff-room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.|The story of Professor Binns's death|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}Professor Binns was still teaching well into his elderly years at Hogwarts, still lecturing students in History of Magic. Now so old that he looked like a wrinkled tortoise,<ref name="COS9"/> Binns went down to the [[staffroom]] on the ground floor and went to sleep in front of the fire. However, he died in his sleep and, when he got up to teach his next class, was a [[ghost]].<ref name="PS8"/> Regardless, he did not seem to notice, though he did begin to fly into his classroom through the blackboard, but his lessons were still just as boring as ever. It was said the most exciting thing that happened in his class was when he entered through the blackboard.<ref name="COS9"/>

===Post-mortem===
====1970s====
During the [[1970s]], Professor Binns taught [[James Potter I|James Potter]], [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], [[Peter Pettigrew]], [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Sirius Black]]. For unknown reasons, Binns gave one of his [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s, that of [[Circe]], to James Potter, which later fell into the hands of [[Quirinus Quirrell]] who put it into his vault, number [[Vault 998|998]].

====1988–1989 school year====
In the [[1988–1989 school year]], one of the groups Binns taught had 16 [[fifth year]] students which included [[Jacob's sibling]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]]. As always, these classes were seen as boring by most students. Sometimes Tonks used her [[Metamorphmagus]] ability to transform into Binns in order to make lessons more interesting. Most of the time, Binns did not pay attention to the class, leading to students doing activities such as tasting candy or playing [[Exploding Snap]].<ref>{{HM}} [[History of Magic]] Class</ref>

When preparing to enter the Portrait Vault, Jacob's sibling went to Binns along with [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Merula Snyde]] in order to learn about [[dragon]]s.<ref name="HM5ch27">{{HM|5|27}}</ref> Later, the three, along with [[Patricia Rakepick]], [[Ben Copper]] and either Charlie Weasley or [[Penny Haywood]] went to Binns to learn about [[Portkey]]s.<ref>{{HM|5|29}}</ref>

====1991–1992 school year====
{{Quote|Easily the most boring lesson was [[History of Magic]]...|[[Harry Potter]] evaluating over his first week at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}During the [[1991–1992 school year]], Professor Binns gained the famous [[Harry Potter]] as a student. However, Binns did not notice his legendary pupil, since he did not pay any attention to his class as he read through his notes, expecting them to copy down bullet points. That year, Binns taught his [[first year]]s about historical figures such as [[Uric the Oddball]] and [[Emeric the Evil]], whom his students always got confused with.<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref> Harry also said that he considered [[History of Magic]] to be "''easily the most boring lesson''" in the school.<ref name="PS8"/> However, Binns also gained a gifted student, [[Hermione Granger]], who alone seemed to be immune to the soporific effects of his lectures, as she listened and took notes seriously.<ref name="COS9"/>

====1992–1993 school year====
{{Dialogue|Hermione Granger|I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets?|Binns|The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.|The legend of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Cuthbert Binns on the Chamber of Secrets.png|250px|thumb|Binns tells his students the story of the [[Chamber of Secrets]]]]

The following year, the Chamber of Secrets was reopened and [[Mrs Norris]], [[Argus Filch]], the [[Hogwarts Caretaker|Caretaker]]'s pet [[cat]], was [[petrification|petrified]] by [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]]. Regardless, the school ran as normal and one of Professor Binns's homework he gave out just after the attack was a three-foot essay on [[Medieval Assembly of European Wizards|The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards]]. While lecturing his [[second year]]s on the [[International Warlocks' Convention of 1289]], Hermione Granger raised her hand and asked about the legend of the Chamber. Despite initially refusing to grant her wish, he relayed the legend after seeing the unusual amount of interest and attention his class were giving him. After reciting the story, each of his pupils argued against his belief that there was no Chamber, but he put a stop to them and their theories and, within five minutes, had bored them to sleep with his lecture.<ref name="COS9">{{COS|B|9}}</ref> Later on in the year, he was visited by the [[Headmaster|Deputy Headmistress]], [[Minerva McGonagall]], who told him that [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] would be absent from his [[History of Magic]] class due to their visit to the petrified [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>

====1993–1994 school year====
During the [[1993–1994 school year]], Professor Binns continued to teach [[Harry Potter]] and his classmates. As preparation for the school year, Professor Binns set his [[third year]] students an essay titled ''[[Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless — discuss]]'', over the [[1993]] summer holidays.<ref name="POA1">{{POA|B|1}}</ref> One night in the winter term, Binns allowed [[Remus Lupin|Professor Remus Lupin]], the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor|teacher]], [[Anti-Dementor lessons|to teach]] Harry how to cast the [[Patronus Charm]] in the [[History of Magic Classroom]].<ref name="POA12">{{POA|B|12}}</ref>

====1994–1995 school year====
{{Quote|Meanwhile Professor Binns, the ghost who taught History of Magic, had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century.|Binns in preparation for his [[fourth year]]s' [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]s|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}The following academic year, Professor Binns gave his [[fourth year]]s a huge workload of writing an entire composition every week, in preparation for their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] examinations in their next year.<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref> Since [[Harry Potter]] had been chosen as a champion for the [[Triwizard Tournament]], he was exempt from the End-of-Term Exams, and so, paid less attention to Binns than usual and spent the time looking up fresh [[hex]]es for the Triwizard Tasks.

====1995–1996 school year====
{{Quote|Today, they suffered three quarters of an hour's droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher's hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.|Professor Binns's first class of the new term|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}[[File:Vlcsnap-30757.png|250px|thumb|left|[[Dolores Umbridge]], [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]]]]
For one of his first classes of the [[1995–1996 school year]], known to be a Monday, Professor Binns lectured his [[fifth year]] students on wars caused and participated in by [[Giant]]s, which would have been interesting had it been taught by a more engaging teacher. After an hour of lecturing, Binns left [[History of Magic Classroom|the classroom]] through the blackboard. He had another [[History of Magic]] class the following Monday, just after [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s appointment as the [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor|High Inquisitor of Hogwarts]], which was noted to be just as boring, drowsy and depressing as the last.<ref name="OOTP12">{{OOTP|B|12}}</ref> That year was the year of his students' [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] examinations, and he made his students write down notes for them to revise from for their exams. It was unknown if Umbridge inspected Binns's classes that year, as she was not present during Harry's lectures.

====1997–1998 school year====
During the [[1997–1998 school year]], Voldemort had seized control over Hogwarts. It was unknown how this affected Professor Binns or if he took any part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the [[Death Eaters]].

====After the War {{c|1998-}}====
It is likely that Professor Binns continued his long tenure as [[Professor]] of [[History of Magic]] after the war.

==Physical description==
[[File:Cuthbert Binns - HM.png|160px|thumb|right|Professor Binns]]

{{Quote|Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.|A brief description of Professor Binns|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

Professor Binns, as being a [[ghost]], was described as looking ancient and shrivelled, and looked a little like an old tortoise when he pursed his lips. He wore glasses, which were small and thick, and had a dry, reedy voice that sounded a lot like an old vacuum cleaner, droning on and on.<ref name="COS9"/>

==Personality and traits==
Professor Binns did not display much of a personality, as all he did was read his notes in a droning voice to his students, while oblivious or disinterested about how everyone simply dozed off from boredom. However, it can be seen that he was very impatient and did not take the liberty of learning his students' names, calling [[Hermione Granger]] "Miss Grant", [[Parvati Patil]] "Miss Pennyfeather", [[Seamus Finnigan]] "O'Flaherty" and even the famous [[Harry Potter]] "Perkins". It's possible he was actually calling them by the names of previous students from years ago, possibly due to senility as he was very old at the time of [[death]]. Binns was also shown to be a firm disbeliever in legends and mythology, dedicating his studies and lectures on "''solid, believable ''fact".<ref name="COS9"/> He was said to have a drawling monotonous voice, which most of his students become quickly bored with.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Being the [[Professor]] of History of Magic at Hogwarts, he was an authority in and thoroughly knowledgeable of [[magic]]al history, teaching the subject for several decades at Hogwarts School, with his rich and varied historical knowledge spanning much of wizarding history.<ref name="COS9"/>
*'''[[Magizoology]]''': Binns was shown to be knowledgeable in the study of magical [[creature]]s, as he had knowledge about the traits of several different breeds of [[dragon]]s.<ref name="HM5ch27"/>
*'''Teaching skills''': Binns must have proven himself to have been an adequate teacher to have acquired his position at Hogwarts as a [[Professor]] whilst he was alive. However, his teaching after his death had proven to be ineffective, as he simply read notes in a droning manner that lulled many students to fall asleep. His unenthusiastic manner of communications, lack of interest in his students' attention, and his refusal to delve into what he considered to be myth, greatly hampered his skills in delivering information to his class and keeping them interested in his subject.

==Possessions==
*'''[[Cuthbert Binns's office|Office]]''': While teaching at Hogwarts, Binns had an office on the fifth floor.
*'''Books''': Binns owned several books, including a [[Draconifors spellbook]], [[Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century]], and [[Cuthbert Binns's books|several other books]].

==Etymology==
*"Binns" is from "binoculars", a slang term for spectacles. Notice that Professor Binns wore very thick glasses.
*A bin is a large storage container. A dustbin is British English for a garbage can. This boring professor could be described as a ghostly storage for information that many Hogwarts students view as rubbish.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Cuthbert_Binns.jpg|160px|thumb|Professor Binns in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*Professor Binns does assign homework and essays, though as he is a ghost it's unknown how he is able to mark them. Given this, it is possible he has a student assistant, like the ones in [[Music classroom monitor|Music]] and [[Male Muggle Studies teacher's student assistant|Muggle Studies]]. Alternatively, he might be in possession of a quill that he can tell what to write and therefore does not need to actually touch it to grade papers.
*Binns has not appeared in any of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]] nor the PC games. His explanation in {{COS}} of the legend of the [[Chamber of Secrets]] is instead given by [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|film]] and [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PC, Mac)|PC game]].
*In the videogame ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', there is one [[History of Magic]] classroom featured on the Fourth Floor corridor. Professor Binns, however, is never seen in the game.
*The only video games Professor Binns has made an appearance (so far) are the Game Boy Color adaptations, {{LEGO|Y1}} and {{HM}}, although he was mentioned in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|Order of the Phoenix]]'' video game. On the Game Boy Color versions Binns has a tendency to fall asleep during lectures and to forget about things.
*Professor Binns' first name only appeared on a list of the Hogwarts professors which was released on {{JKRS}}.{{fact}}
*Professor Binns is seen in the book series as a stereotyped old man; he forgets things seconds after hearing them, has a slow droning voice, and gets irritable at times.
*As Binns became a [[ghost]], he can no longer move beyond the [[veil]], and will remain earthbound for all eternity.{{fact}} This means that unless he resigns or is sacked, he would be the History of Magic teacher forever.
*Since Binns died in the [[staffroom]], and continued on as if nothing happened, it can be assumed that he feared [[death]] (or what lies beyond the [[veil]]). Perhaps teaching was what Binns wanted to do, for literally all eternity.
*In "Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey" ride in Orlando Florida, Dumbledore mentions that Professor Binns will be giving the audience a lecture entitled ''[[Hogwarts Through the Centuries]]'' and that it will be "...long". Harry, Ron and Hermione sneak the audience out of the [[Classroom 3C|Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom]] before Professor Binns shows up.
*In {{COS}}, Binns states, "''There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard!''" Ironically enough, there ''is'' a secret broom cupboard in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]: the [[Fred and George Weasley|Weasley twins]] told Harry that when they were running away from [[Argus Filch|Filch]] once, they took refuge in a broom cupboard, which was later revealed to be the [[Room of Requirement]].
*According to the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]] transcript on thepensieve.org, Professor Binns makes an appearance in the film, as a ghost who reports to Dumbledore shortly after "The Flight of the [[Fat Lady]]." However, if this is true, none of Binns' more memorable traits are portrayed in the films.
*Binns' recollection of his father strongly suggests that not only did he pick up his droning style of speech from him, but that like his own students, it put Binns himself to sleep from boredom.
*In the [[1989–1990 school year]] as seen in {{HM}}, Binns asked his Sixth-Year students (aged 16 or 17) whether they have served in the First World War, despite that one must be 18 to enlist (although many boys in real life have served by lying about their age). This would indicate that Binns had been teaching since at least 1918, and his memory had not moved on since then.<ref>{{HM|6|33}}</ref>
===Author's comments===
"''The most productive ghost at Hogwarts is, of course, Professor Binns, the old History of Magic teacher who fell asleep in front of the staff-room fire one day and simply got up to give his next class, leaving his body behind. There is some debate as to whether or not Professor Binns realises he is dead. While his entrance to lessons through the blackboard is vaguely amusing the first time students see it, he is not the most stimulating teacher.''

''The inspiration for Professor Binns was an old professor at my university, who gave every lecture with his eyes closed, rocking backwards and forwards slightly on his toes. While he was a brilliant man, who disgorged an immense amount of valuable information at every lecture, his disconnect with his students was total. Professor Binns is only dimly aware of his living students, and is astonished when they begin asking him questions.''"
