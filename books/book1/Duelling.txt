{{Spoiler|MA|WU|HM}}[[File:Duel in ministry.gif|frame|[[Albus Dumbledore]] duelling [[Tom Riddle]] in the [[Duel in the Ministry Atrium|Ministry Altrium]]]]

{{Quote|I'd take you on any time on my own. Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only — no [[Muggle duelling|contact]].|[[Draco Malfoy]] issuing a challenge to [[Harry Potter]] for a formal duel|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
A '''Wizard's duel''' was a formal practice in [[wizarding world|wizarding]] culture in which two or more [[Wizardkind|wizards or witches]] engaged in combat under the condition that only [[magic]]al means could be used.<ref name="PS9"/> The combatants faced each other and bowed, as a sign of respect, before they placed themselves in an [[accepted combative position]] and, at the count of three, attempted to [[Disarming Charm|disarm]], [[Stunning Spell|stun]], injure, defeat, or kill each other in order to force submission, and thus a winner would be decided.

Duelling also existed as a sport in the same way that fencing is a sport in the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world. Outside of actual combat it could be turned into a friendly sporting competition.

==History==
{{Quote|The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead centre of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. |Harry Potter's and Voldemort's infamous final duel|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}Sometime before 1984, [[Duelling Room|a room]] was set aside at [[Hogwarts Castle]] to allow students to practise duelling. The marks on the walls from various spells were left as a visual reminder of the dangers associated with the practice. Duelling outside of this environment was strictly forbidden and grounds for [[Discipline at Hogwarts|expulsion]].

During the [[1984–1985 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Merula Snyde]] were caught duelling over Merula's bullying of [[Ben Copper]]. In response, [[Albus Dumbledore]] formed the [[Hogwarts Duelling Club]], under the supervision of [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] and Jacob's sibling's [[Head of House]], to allow students to practise in a safe and supervised manner. The club presumably ended sometime before 1992.

[[File:B2C11M2 Great Hall Duelling Club.png|251x251px|thumb|left|The first and last meeting of the [[Duelling Club]] at Hogwarts]]

During the [[1992-1993 school year]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] allowed then [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Professor]], [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], to start a [[Duelling Club]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], perhaps in part because he saw [[Dark Arts|dark times]] coming in the [[wizarding world]] and therefore the need for training students in the art of battle. Professor Lockhart taught the formalities of duelling: bowing, holding the [[wand]] in a certain way, and flourishing the wand in the attack.<ref name="COS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref> Harry found himself, two years later, facing [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in a desperate duel to the death. Voldemort used the Imperius Curse to force Harry to bow and obey the other niceties of duelling. Harry, who had learned to [[Spell resistance|resist]] the [[Imperius Curse]], used the moment to duck for cover, although he later successfully defeated Voldemort using the one spell he learned from Snape during Duelling Club — the [[Disarming Charm]].<ref name="GOF34"/>

The following year, Harry began teaching duelling techniques as part of his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] student organisation, [[Dumbledore's Army]]. He started off easily with practising the Disarming Charm and told the group, especially a disbelieving [[Zacharias Smith]], that the [[charm]] actually saved his life during his first duel with [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="OOTP18">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref> Harry was so successful and instructive as a teacher that some of the students he had taught fought well against experienced [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="OOTP35"/> Some of them used those same duelling skills against [[Malfoy family|Malfoy]], [[Crabbe]], and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]] aboard the [[Hogwarts Express]] on the way home from Hogwarts, when they tried to assault Harry, resulting in his friends [[hex]]ing them into looking like bloated [[slug]]s.<ref name="OOTP38">{{OOTP|B|38}}</ref>

Members of Dumbledore’s Army proved themselves to be valiant duellists, in the subsequent battles of the [[Second Wizarding War]]: the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]],<ref name="HBP28"/> [[Battle of the Seven Potters]],<ref name="DH4"/> and the climactic [[Battle of Hogwarts]],<ref name="DH31"/> where many of them even managed to hold their own against seasoned Death Eaters, such as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]].<ref name="DH36"/>

Professor [[Filius Flitwick]] was rumoured to be a champion duellist. It is unknown if this was true and if it was, whether he was a champion of some particular competition.

The term “[[Warlock]]” originally referred to a Wizard who was trained in duelling and martial magic, as well as to those who had performed feats of bravery.<ref name="TBB">''[[The Warlock's Hairy Heart]]'' from {{TBB}}</ref>

During the fall of [[1995]], the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] was trying to get other countries to sign an [[International Ban on Duelling]]. [[Percy Weasley]] in particular was working to get the [[Transylvania]]ns on board.<ref name="GOF23">{{GOF|B|23}}</ref> It is uncertain if this type of duelling was the same as the sport variety, or if it referred to the more lethal “pistols at dawn” variety of duel.

[[File:Grandpre Dueling Wizards.jpg|240x240px|thumb|A spectacular duel in the [[Atrium|Ministry Atrium]]]]

A full-on wizard’s duel was something incredible to behold. The duel between [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] and [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] in 1945 was legendary,<ref name="DH2">{{DH|B|2}}</ref> and the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the Ministry Atrium at the climax of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries was equally spectacular.<ref name="OOTP36"/>

Many duels involved [[non-verbal spells]] for speed, but saying the incantations aloud seemed to be preferred if there was time (e.g. Voldemort used verbal spells in his duels with Harry). The [[Shield Charm]] was one of the most common duelling spells.<ref>''[[Book of Spells]]''</ref> Other spells typically used in duelling included [[Stunning Spell]]s, the [[Impediment Jinx]], the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]], and the [[Dancing Feet Spell]]. Harry’s use of the Disarming Charm in duelling could be considered somewhat unusual in more serious and life-threatening situations, but this spell was actually one of the key spells to any duellist’s arsenal.<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}}</ref>

[[Aspen]] wands were favoured by those who aspired to be top duellists. In fact, a secretive 18th century duelling club called itself the [[The Silver Spears|Silver Spears]] because they exclusively used aspen wands. Other good wands for duelling included red [[English oak|oak]] and [[rowan]]. Yew wands were feared in duels for their association with curses and evil magic.<ref name="Wand wood">{{WW|wand-woods}}</ref>

Winners of Duelling competitions included: [[Alberta Toothill]]: Winner of the [[All-England Wizarding Duelling Competition]] of 1430. Famously overcame the favorite, Samson Wiblin, with a [[Blasting Curse|Blasting Charm]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Smudgling]], who won the title of [[Supreme Dueller]] in a famous Dartmoor contest in 1379 using a spell of possibly her own invention, the Disarming Charm.<ref name="WBS"/>

==Rules==
{{Quote|You have been taught how to duel Harry Potter? We bow to each other, Harry. Come, the niceties must be observed... Dumbledore would like you to show manners...|[[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to Harry Potter in the graveyard of Little Hangleton|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}[[File:Duel harry draco.gif|241x241px|left|frame|The beginning stage of a formal duel, after the challenge has been accepted]]

There were rules and customs that defined how a proper duel was performed, and that were normally known to wizards and witches born to magical families, even at a young age. For instance, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] told [[Harry Potter]] some of the rules of duelling as a [[first year]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] after Harry was challenged to a duel by [[Draco Malfoy]] in [[1991]].<ref name="PS9"/> In the [[1992–1993 school year]], [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] formed the duelling club, in which duelling strips were used in a system similar to that of modern fencing.<ref name="COS11"/>

===The challenge===
In a formal duel, one wizard or witch challenged another, although it is implied that duels were not commonplace in modern polite society. If the other person accepted, they then arranged a meeting time and place for the duel. Draco challenged Harry this way in their first year, though it was really an attempt to get Harry into trouble for being out of his dormitories after curfew.<ref name="PS9">{{PS|B|9}}</ref> Opponents bowed to one another before beginning to fight, as [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] reminded [[Harry Potter]] before their [[Return of Lord Voldemort|duel]] in the graveyard of [[Little Hangleton]] in [[1995]].<ref name="GOF34">{{GOF|B|34}}</ref> Lockhart went as far as twirling his hands while bowing, possibly trying to make himself look more gentlemanly.<ref name="COS11"/> However, duellists who did not respect their opponents would not usually bow correctly, as Snape simply jerked his head, while Harry, [[Draco Malfoy]],<ref name="COS11"/> and Voldemort<ref name="GOF34"/> barely bent their heads at all.

===Seconds===
{{Quote|Well, a second's there to take over if you die...|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}Duellists would often have a "[[second]]" in a formal duel — a person, usually a trusted ally, who would act as a replacement for one duellist if necessary. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] volunteered to be Harry's second in the aforementioned planned duel with Draco, who chose [[Vincent Crabbe]].<ref name="COS11"/>

===Limits===
[[File:Duel graveyard.gif|245x245px|thumb|[[Reverse Spell|Priori Incantatem]] initiated during the duel between [[Harry Potter]] and [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] in 1995]]

There was a standard rule in duels that only [[magic]]al means could be used to fight an opponent, and that there was to be no [[Muggle duelling|physical contact]] (which [[wizardkind]] refers to as Muggle duelling) between the duellists. [[Millicent Bulstrode]] broke this rule when she duelled [[Hermione Granger]] in [[1992]] in the [[Duelling Club]]; the much larger girl ended up wrestling Hermione to the ground and holding her in a headlock.<ref name="COS11"/>

The parties of a duel could also agree to other limits, unless they were planning to duel to the death, which was only common practice in a war. For example, [[Minerva McGonagall]] informed fellow professor [[Horace Slughorn]] just before the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] that if any [[Slytherin]] attempted to sabotage their defence efforts or to fight them, they would "''duel to kill''", which alarmed him.<ref name="DH30">{{DH|B|30}}</ref> This may indicate that duellists generally agreed not to use particularly dangerous and/or illegal spells, such as the [[Unforgivable Curses]].

==Practice duels==
Duels could also be used for training purposes, as was the case at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], which had a [[Hogwarts Duelling Club|club]] that students could join to hone their skill at magical self-defence lead by [[Professor]] [[Filius Flitwick]], which occupied a room where in the [[Dungeons]] of the castle, where students engaged each other while overseen by a teacher. Any damage done to it was left unattended to, so the students there could see them and remember the implications behind the act of duelling.<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref>
