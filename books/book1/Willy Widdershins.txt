{{Dialogue a-b-c|Dolores Umbridge|I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired. He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me —|Minerva McGonagall|Oh, so that's why he wasn't prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets! What an interesting insight into our justice system!|Dexter Fortescue|Blatant corruption! The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!|[[Dolores Umbridge]], [[Minerva McGonagall]], and the portrait of [[Dexter Fortescue]] discussing the Ministry's actions about Willy Widdershins|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
