{{Quote|Defence Against the Dark Arts ''[…]'' was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.|[[Albus Dumbledore]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Professor Galatea Merrythought''' was a British [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from around [[1895]] until her retirement in [[1945]]. From some point between the [[1920s]] and the [[1940s]], she taught [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. 

Before her retirement, she worked alongside [[Albus Dumbledore]] and [[Horace Slughorn]], her former students; after her retirement, [[Tom Riddle]], another one of her pupils, was refused the chance to take her place, and so he vengefully [[Jinx on the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher|jinxed the post]] so no professor could hold the occupation for longer than a year.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nothing is known of Galatea Merrythought's past, although it is likely that she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and would have purchased her [[wand]] from [[Ollivanders|Ollivanders Wand Shop]] at [[Diagon Alley]] at the age of eleven. She would have graduated at the age of seventeen and it is likely that she had high [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] marks — almost definitely a [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] in the field.

===Career at Hogwarts===
====Early years====
{{Quote|Dumbledore, in his time had access to superb teachers at Hogwarts…|A description of Albus Dumbledore's teachers, which included Merrythought|http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm/}}
[[File:Slughorn's Second office.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Professor Merrythought's office]]

Merrythought returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] to teach sometime around [[1895]],<ref name="HBP20">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref> though what subject is unclear. Among her pupils was a young [[Gryffindor]] named [[Albus Dumbledore]]; other students she taught included [[Elphias Doge]], [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], [[Horace Slughorn]], [[Tom Riddle]], and [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. The [[Headmaster]] during her early years was presumably [[Professor]] [[Phineas Nigellus Black]], although she also went on to work under [[Professor]] [[Armando Dippet]].

Having authored at least two books on the subject (''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts (Book)|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]'', and ''[[Advanced Defence Against the Dark Arts]]'', required reading when [[Albus Dumbledore]] was teaching the subject in the 1910s),<ref name="MinaLima">[https://store.minalima.com/shop/new-arrivals/new-fantastic-beasts/advanced-defence-against-the-dark-arts-1910-edition/ "Advanced Defence Against the Dark Arts - 1910 Edition"] from [[MinaLima Design]] (prop featured in {{COG}})</ref> at an unknown point in her teaching career, certainly between 1927 and 1945, Professor Merrythought became the [[Professor]] of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], taking ownership of [[Classroom 3C]] and [[Horace Slughorn's second office|an office on the sixth floor]].

====The Chamber of Secrets and retirement====
{{Quote|Sir? Is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?|[[Tom Riddle]] questioning [[Horace Slughorn]], the [[Potions Master]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}

Many years later, when [[Armando Dippet|Professor Dippet]] was Headmaster, Galatea became the teacher of a brilliant student named [[Tom Riddle]]. Her fellow colleagues, and possibly Galatea herself, had been impressed by Riddle's skills and determination, and taught him all they knew. During her fifth year of teaching Riddle, the [[Chamber of Secrets]] was opened and many of her students were petrified. Eventually, a third-year named [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was accused of releasing [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk|Slytherin's monster]] from the Chamber and he was expelled. It was during this year that Galatea decided to retire, whether it was because of these events or not, and she left the school the following year.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Professor Merrythought was an expert in fighting the [[Dark Arts]], having been a highly respected Professor of this subject at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for many years. She authored numerous books in the field, such as ''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts (book)|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]'' and ''[[Advanced Defence Against the Dark Arts]]'', meaning she was highly knowledgeable and accomplished in this branch of [[magic]]. 

==Etymology==
*The surname Merrythought could imply that she was adept at conjuring the [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]], which would fit with her having taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts.
*Her given name Galatea may well be derived from Greek mythology. In Ancient Greek, the root forms would be ''gala(-ktos)'', meaning "milk", and ''-tea'', "white". There are three notable women in Greek mythology named Galatea:
*#Galatea of Sicily, one of the fifty [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereid Nereids]  (daughters of Nereus and Doris), was courted by both Polyphemus and Acis.
*#Galatea of Cyprus was the wife of King Pygmalion. Pygmalion was famous for having created a statue of Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, that the goddess brought to life at his request. After receiving the gift of life, Galatea married the king.
*#Galatea was the name of the wife of King Lamprus. Galatea prayed to the Greek goddess Leto to transform her daughter into a son so she would not have to sacrifice her according to the command of her husband. Leto granted Galatea's request.

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|And I'll want Professor Merrythought's old office! Not the water closet I had before!|[[Horace Slughorn]] in {{HBP|F}}|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|sixth film]], after finally agreeing to come back and teach at Hogwarts, [[Horace Slughorn]] demands that when he comes back to Hogwarts, he is given Merrythought's old [[Horace Slughorn's second office|office]]; however, this does not coincide with the book, in which he merely asks for a pay raise.
*A woman is seen in [[Tom Riddle]]'s memory in {{COS|F}}, this could possibly be Galatea.
*{{COG}} revealed that Albus Dumbledore taught Defence Against the Dark Arts in the 1910s and 1920s, when Professor Merrythought already taught at Hogwarts. It's unknown if Professor Merrythought and Professor Dumbledore taught together or if she taught another subject before.
