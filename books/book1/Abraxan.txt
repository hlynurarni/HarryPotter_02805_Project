The '''Abraxan''' is a breed of [[Winged horse]]. They are gigantic and extremely powerful and have an appearance akin to that of a palomino [[horse]]. [[Abraxan hair]] is white in colour, and is used as an ingredient in [[Potion|Potion-making]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref> An Abraxan is a rare possible corporeal form of the [[Patronus Charm]].<ref>{{See image|File:AbraxanWingedHorse-patronus.jpg}}</ref>
==History==
[[File:Abraxan_Pottermore.png|250px|thumb|left|Maxime's Abraxans on the grounds of Hogwarts]]
[[Olympe Maxime|Madame Olympe Maxime]], Headmistress of [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]], bred them and used them to pull her carriage. Her horses drank only [[single malt whiskey]] and required forceful handling; it is unknown if this is true for the entire breed.<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

In the [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]], [[Jacob's sibling]] took care of an Abraxan in the [[Magical Creatures Reserve]].<ref>{{HM}}</ref> One time, [[Rubeus Hagrid]] asked Jacob's sibling to help him with research on Abraxans. Jacob's sibling introduced their friend [[Penny Haywood]] to the Abraxan. However, when the two brought the Abraxan to the [[Training Grounds]], it escaped.<ref>{{HM|?|Horsing Around}}</ref>

Madame Maxime used the Abraxans to travel to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1985–1986 school year]], when she came to the school alongside Beauxbatons student [[Aurélie Dumont]]. During the visit, Jacob's sibling and Penny helped Madame Maxime take care of the Abraxans as Hagrid and [[Silvanus Kettleburn]] were unavailable for help at that time.<ref>{{HM|2|Hosting the Beauxbatons}}</ref>

In [[1994]], the Abraxans came to Hogwarts with Madame Maxime and Beauxbatons students who wanted to compete in the [[Triwizard Tournament]], including [[Fleur Delacour]].<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

In [[1997]] after the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]] the Abraxans returned to Hogwarts flying their powder-blue [[Beauxbatons Carriage|carriage]] with them, in which Olympe Maxime was travelling in to attend the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

During the [[Calamity]] which affected the [[Wizarding world]] in the [[2010s]], Abraxans were some of the magical creatures that were affected by this strange event.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Their name is probably derived from '''Abraxas''', one of the horses of Aurora, the Dawn, in Roman mythology.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Rubeus Hagrid]] once claimed to have a friend who bred Abraxan horses, though this was likely only part of a story that he made up to distract [[Dolores Umbridge]].<ref name="op20">{{OOTP|B|20}}</ref> Alternatively, he may have been referring to [[Olympe Maxime]].
*In the film adaptation, they had grey coats instead of palomino coats.
*The Abraxan is one of the nine possible Patronus forms for [[Jacob's sibling]]. It can be achieved by having a higher Knowledge stat or choosing the option "discover truth" and later, choosing "equine" as the Patronus form.<ref>{{HM|4|Conjure a Patronus}}</ref>
