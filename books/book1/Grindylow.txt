{{Quote|A sickly green [[creature]] with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly fingers.|Description|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
A '''Grindylow''' is a small, horned, pale-green skinned [[water demon]] native to [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].<ref name="FBR"/>  

==Life cycle==
The first stage of a Grindylow's life cycle is the larval stage, where it is referred to as a [[Grypt]]. It is also known by several local names, such as a "''Pollywiggle''" in [[Ilkley]], a "''Candypole''" in [[Kettlewell]], and a "''Jarvis''" in [[Sheffield]].<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

==Behaviour==
[[File:GrindylowFBIE.png|250px|thumb|A Grindylow eating fish]]
Aggressive towards [[Wizardkind|witches, wizards]] and [[Non-magic people|muggle]]s alike, the Grindylow has only ever been tamed by [[merpeople]]; the half-fish water dwellers who sometimes keep them as pets.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

==Diet==
Grindylows survive, for the most part, on fish, algae, and small sea creatures; however, occasionally they will eat [[human]]s (it is for this reason that they are classified as [[Dark Arts|dark creatures]]).<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

==Habitat==
[[File:Grindylow_HP4.png|thumb|A Grindylow in the [[Great Lake]]]]
These [[creature]]s are found in the weed beds at the bottom of [[Great Lake|lake]]s in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

The Grindylow is particularly prevalent in [[Yorkshire]], where it displays a large amount of physical variation. It is generally found in still or stagnant water. In more recent years, Grindylows have taken to urban environments such as Porter Beach in the heart of [[Sheffield]], where they shelter in submerged shopping trolleys and traffic cones.<ref name="HPAillustrated">{{POA}}, fully illustrated edition - ''[[Aquatic Wonders of Yorkshire: A Wizard's Field Guide]]''</ref>

==Physical appearance==
The Grindylow is a sickly green colour, with green teeth and small pointy horns on its head. It has long, strong (albeit brittle) fingers which it uses to strangle its prey, and is a rather good swimmer, since it is adapted to live in water.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

==Defence==
The Grindylow has long, brittle fingers which despite their fragility are rather strong. The trick to escaping a Grindylow is to break their grip on a person; it can also be noted that the [[Revulsion Jinx]] may help with this task, as underwater it shoots jets of boiling hot water.<ref name="GOF26">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref> 

==History==
[[File:Grindylow FB.jpg|200x200px|thumb|left|Grindylow in the Newt Scamander's suitcase]]
[[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] had several Grindylows in [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|his suitcase]] during his travels to [[New York]] in [[1926]].<ref name="FBS">{{FB|S}}</ref>

In the [[1989–1990 school year]], the Grindylows attacked the [[Merpeople]] in the lake.<ref>{{HM|6|12}}</ref>

[[Professor]] [[Remus Lupin]] ordered a Grindylow in [[1993]] for his [[third year]] class to study for [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].<ref name="POA8">{{POA|B|8}}</ref> After his resignation, he left behind the tank in which the Grindylow was kept.<ref name="PA22">{{POA|B|22}}</ref>

[[1995|One year later]], the Grindylows of the Black Lake at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] attacked the students competing in the [[1994–1995 school year|1994-1995]] [[Triwizard Tournament]]. They caused the early retirement from the task of [[Fleur Delacour]], and harassed [[Harry Potter]]. Harry however managed to repel a swarm of Grindylows by using the [[Revulsion Jinx]] underwater, blasting them with hot water and releasing himself from their tight grip, allowing him to continue swimming.<ref name="GOF26">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]], at [[The Burrow]], Remus Lupin verified Harry's identity by asking "What '''creature sat''' in the '''corner''' the first time that '''Harry Potter visited my office''' at '''Hogwarts'''?" Harry correctly answered Grindylow, which proved to Lupin that he was not a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] impostor.<ref name="DH5">{{DH|B|5}}</ref>

There was a black market trade in Grindylows, as some wizards enjoyed them (illegally) as a delicacy.<ref name="WU">{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: Baby Beasts"</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Grindylow.png|200px|right|Concept art of a Grindylow from {{GOF|F}}]]
*The {{wplink|Grindylow}} is a name for a type of [[Sprite|water spirit]] said to grab little children from the edge of a body of water and drown them. The term is used in the folktales of [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]].
[[File:GrindylowPOP.png|thumb|A Grindylow as a [[POP! Vinyl]]]]
*In {{GOF|FA}}, the Grindylow is a small creature with tentacles and two dangling tentacles on its head. In the book, there is no such description. The books also describe Grindylows as sickly green in colour; the films depict them as beige.
*Originally, the Grindylow were meant to be more like Angler Fish according to The Creature Vault.
*In {{FB|IE}}, as imagined by illustrator [[Olivia Lomenech Gill]], Grindylows are humanoid creatures, much more how like the [[Wikipedia:Devil|devil]] or [[Wikipedia:Demon|demons]] are traditionally depicted. 
*Although Grindylows are aggressive [[Dark Arts|dark]] [[creature]]s and are covered in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classes, they are classified as XX by the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. The reason why is most likely that they can be tamed by [[Merpeople]], and that also they can be repelled easily by [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] using [[spell]]s such as the [[Revulsion Jinx]].
