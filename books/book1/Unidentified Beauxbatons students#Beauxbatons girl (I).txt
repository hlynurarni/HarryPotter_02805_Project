The following is a list of '''[[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] students''' whose names are unknown.

==Beauxbatons boy==
This '''boy''' attended [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] during the [[Triwizard Tournament]].

===Biography===
This wizard was born in either [[1977]] or [[1978]]. He was one of the students representing Beauxbatons to potentially compete in the [[1994]] Triwizard Tournament.

After failing to be chosen as champion, the boy remained at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to watch his champion, [[Fleur Delacour]]. He attended the [[Yule Ball]], during which he noticed [[Parvati Patil]] and asked her for a dance. Parvati eagerly accepted, and the two spent the rest of the night together.<ref>{{GOF|B|23}}</ref> Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy spent large amounts of time together, meeting in [[Hogsmeade]] at least once.<ref>{{GOF|B|24}}</ref>

It was unknown what happened to the Beauxbatons boy after the Triwizard Tournament, or if he and Parvati remained in contact.

===Behind the scenes===
*The Beauxbatons boy was replaced by [[Igor Karkaroff's aide]] in {{GOF|FA}}, probably because, in the movie, Beauxbatons is portrayed as an all-girls' school.
