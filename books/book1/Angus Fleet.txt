'''Angus Fleet''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who lived in [[Wikipedia:Peebles|Peebles]], [[Scotland]]. On [[1 September]], [[1992]], the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' reported that Fleet spotted a [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]] in flight, and informed the police of the sighting.

==Behind the scenes==
*Angus Fleet was presumably one of the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s that [[Molly Weasley]] mentioned to her son [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], saying that he caused [[Arthur Weasley]] to face an inquiry at [[British Ministry of Magic|work]].<ref>{{COS}}</ref>
*In the Norwegian translation of {{COS}} he's from [[Glasgow]].

==Etymology==
The name "Angus" possibly means "one strength" derived from Irish Ã³en "one" and gus "force, strength, energy". Aonghus (sometimes surnamed Mac Og meaning "young son") was the Irish god of love and youth. The name was also borne by an 8th-century Pictish king and several Irish kings.
