'''Sally-Anne Perks''' (c. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]], though she may not have stayed for her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] year.<ref>During a practical examination of their O.W.L.s, Sally-Anne was not called to take her test. In alphabetical order, she would have appeared after the Patil twins but before Harry Potter.</ref> She was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] right before [[Harry Potter]] and was either sorted into [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], or [[Slytherin]] house.

==Behind the scenes==
*Although Sally-Anne Perks was in the same year as Harry in {{PS}}, there is no other mention of her in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|series]].
**However, she may be the [[Bespectacled Slytherin girl|unidentified bespectacled girl]] or one of the unnamed Gryffindor girls in Harry's year, in {{PS|F}}. It is also possible that she was one of the two un-named Hufflepuff girls in Harry's year, since only [[Susan Bones]], [[Hannah Abbott]] and [[Megan Jones]] were mentioned to be sorted into Hufflepuff.
*Sally-Anne Perks was not called to take her test for a practical examination in the [[1996]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]]. Her turn should have come after the [[Padma and Parvati Patil|Patil twins]] but before [[Harry Potter]]. This could just be a mistake of [[J. K. Rowling]], or Sally-Anne may have been unable to attend her test. She could also have repeated one or more years, which would make her a fourth or younger year while Harry was in his fifth year.
*The option for Perks as a family name for the protagonist of {{FBC}} suggests Sally-Anne may have been a [[half-blood]] or a [[pure-blood]].
