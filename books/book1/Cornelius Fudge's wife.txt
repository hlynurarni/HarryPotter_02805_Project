{{Quote|Thank you, [[Percy Weasley|Weatherby]], and when you have done that, I would like a cup of tea. My wife and son will be arriving shortly, we are attending a concert tonight with Mr and Mrs Fudge.|[[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch Snr]] in a state of delirium|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
'''Mrs Fudge''' was the wife of former [[Minister for Magic]], [[Cornelius Fudge]]. [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]] once suffered an attack of delirium in which he mentioned that his [[Bartemius Crouch Jnr's mother|wife]] and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|son]] were to attend a concert with the couple.<ref>{{GOF|B|28}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*As Barty Crouch Snr was delirious at the time he mentioned Mrs Fudge, it is possible that she does not exist any more than as a figment of Crouch's delusions.
