The '''Montgomery sisters''' were two [[Wizardkind|witches]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1997]]. Their five-year old [[Montgomery|brother]] was bitten by the savage [[werewolf]] [[Fenrir Greyback]] when their mother refused to help the [[Death Eaters]]. Their brother later [[Death|died]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], because the [[Healer]]s there were unable to save his life, given the extent of his injuries.<ref name="HBP22">{{HBP|B|22}}</ref>
