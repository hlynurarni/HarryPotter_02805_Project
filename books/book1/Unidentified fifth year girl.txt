This '''unidentified [[fifth year]]''' asked [[Harry Potter]] to go with her to the [[Yule Ball]] with her in [[1994]]. Harry, however, turned her down.<ref name="GOF22">{{GOF|B|22}}</ref>

She was described as ''"quite good looking"'' by [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. She was a foot taller than Harry Potter, which Harry thought would look awkward if he tried to dance with her at the ball.
