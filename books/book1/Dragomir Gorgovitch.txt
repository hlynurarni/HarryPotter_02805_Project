}}'''Dragomir Gorgovitch''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]Â who played as a [[Chaser]] for the [[Chudley Cannons]].

==Biography==
Gorgovitch transferred to the Cannons in [[1995]] for a "''record fee,''" and held the record for the most [[Quaffle]] drops in a season. [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] tried not to think about him if he could, probably because his favourite team was the Cannons.<ref name="DH7">{{DH|B|7}}</ref>

In [[1997]], after [[Harry Potter]] had a vision about [[wandmaker]] [[Mykew Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]], Ron wondered if he was referring to Gorgovitch instead; as, at the time, Harry didn't know who Gregorovitch was, the only hint he had to go on was that he may have been somehow connected to [[Quidditch]].<ref name="DH7">{{DH|B|7}}</ref>

When selecting an alias for himself, during the [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)]], Ron named himself Dragomir Despard, most likely an allusion to Dragomir Gorgovitch.<ref name="DH26">{{DH|B|26}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Dragomir" means "precious and peaceful" from the Slavic element ''dorgu'' meaning "precious" combined with ''mir'' "peace".
