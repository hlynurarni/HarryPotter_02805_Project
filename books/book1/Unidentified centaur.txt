This '''[[centaur]]''' was a member of the [[Forbidden Forest Centaur colony]].<ref name="OOTP33"/>

==Biography==
During the [[Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest]] in [[1996]], he grabbed [[Harry Potter]] as he and the other [[Centaur]]s tried to figure out to do with him and [[Hermione Granger]]. When Hermione suggested that they help them, this centaur roared that they did not help [[Human]]s. An [[Unidentified dun-coloured centaur]] suggested that they go with [[Dolores Umbridge]]. Luckily, the [[giant]] [[Grawp]] chased them away.<ref name="OOTP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref>
