'''Olive Hornby''' (fl. [[1940s]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who used to harass and bully [[Myrtle Warren]] about her glasses when they were school girls at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Olive was born between [[1926]] and [[1932]], around the time [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]] and born. She also had a [[Olive Hornby's brother|brother]].

===Hogwarts School===
When she was eleven years-old, Olive received a letter, accepting her into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. It's unknown if she was older than or was the same age as [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]], so their [[Sorting ceremony|Sorting]] might have been at the same time or in different years.

====Bullying Myrtle====
[[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]] was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]] in [[1940]]. She was constantly teased and bullied by her fellow students. On one such occasion, Olive cruelly taunted her about her glasses, which was the reason Myrtle was in the bathroom that concealed the [[Chamber of Secrets]] on the [[13 June|night of her murder]].<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> After realising that no one had seen [[Myrtle Warren|Myrtle]] for a couple of hours, and knowing that Olive Hornby had previously bullied Myrtle, Professor [[Armando Dippet]], then-[[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts, requested her to go and look for Myrtle. When Olive got to the bathroom, the first thing she saw was Myrtle's [[Death|dead]] body lying on the floor. This left Olive in a state of shock and horror, according to Myrtle's [[ghost]], who watched the scene with delight.<ref name="GOF25">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref>

===Haunted by Moaning Myrtle===
[[Myrtle Warren|Moaning Myrtle]], as Myrtle's ghost was now known, haunted Olive Hornby for a long period of time, even after she left Hogwarts.<ref>If she was still at Hogwarts, Olive would force Moaning Myrtle to go away by calling the [[Headmaster]] or her parents, not the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].</ref> After Moaning Myrtle interrupted her [[Olive Hornby's brother|brother]]'s wedding, Olive went to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to get rid of the troublesome ghost. [[Myrtle Warren]] was then sent back to [[Hogwarts Castle]], where she haunted the bathroom in which she died.<ref name="GOF25">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref>

===Death===
Olive Hornby was already [[Death|dead]] before the events surrounding the [[1994–1995 school year|1994-1995]] [[Triwizard Tournament]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], although it is unknown what year she actually died.<ref>From Moaning Myrtle's remark in {{GOF}} (emphasis added): "''And then she saw my body...ooooh, she didn't forget that '''''until her dying day''''', I made sure of that...''"</ref>

==Etymology==
*The olive branch to the ancient Greeks, was sacred to Athena and was a sign of peace.
*Her last name, ''Hornby'', is an Old Norse personal name composed of the elements ''horn'' ‘horn' + ''boði'' ‘messenger'. This could possibly point to the fact that Olive was most likely the first to send the message about Myrtle's death. Horns were also a symbol of power in many cultures, which could mean that Olive had power and authority over Myrtle. It might also be a "Last Trump" (in the sense of trumpet) reference.
