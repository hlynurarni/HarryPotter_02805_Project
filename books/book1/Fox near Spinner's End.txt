This '''[[fox]]''' lived by the river near [[Spinner's End]], the erstwhile home of [[Severus Snape]].<ref name="HBP2"/>

==Biography==
The fox was apparently underfed, as it was described as scrawny, and was scavenging amongst rubbish for food. The fox was present when [[Narcissa Malfoy]] and her sister [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] [[Apparition|Apparated]] to Spinner's End to meet with [[Severus Snape]]. The fox attempted to flee the area, but was killed by Bellatrix via a [[Nonverbal spell|nonverbal]] [[Killing Curse]] when it ran, as she thought it may have been an [[Auror]], in her fear of getting caught.<ref name="HBP2">{{HBP|B|2}}</ref>
