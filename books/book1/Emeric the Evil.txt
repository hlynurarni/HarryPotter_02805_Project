'''Emeric the Evil''' was a short-lived but exceptionally aggressive [[Dark Wizard]]. He was once the master of the [[Elder Wand]]. With it, he terrorised the south of [[England]] in the early [[Middle Ages]]. He was "''slaughtered''" in a ferocious [[Duel Between Emeric the Evil and Egbert the Egregious|duel]] against [[Egbert the Egregious]].<ref>{{TBB|E}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "''The Tale of the Three Brothers''"''</ref>

During their [[History of Magic]] lessons with [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]], the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students often mixed up Emeric the Evil with [[Uric the Oddball]].<ref>{{PS|B|8}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Emeric" is a Germanic name, in which the second element is ''ric'' meaning "power". The first element may be ''ermen'' "whole, universal" (making it a relative of ''Ermenrich''), ''amal'' "work, labour" (making it a relative of ''Amalric'') or ''heim'' "home" (making it a relative of ''Henry''). It is likely that several forms merged into a single name.
