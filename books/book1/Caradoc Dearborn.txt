'''Caradoc Dearborn''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He fought in the [[First Wizarding War]] and was presumably murdered by [[Death Eaters]] before the end of the war. His body was never found.<ref name="OOTP9"/>

==Biography==
During the [[First Wizarding War]], Caradoc became a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], an organisation led and founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]], in order to oppose the [[Tom Riddle|Dark Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="OOTP9"/>

During the height of the conflict, Caradoc vanished and was never heard from afterwards. According to [[Alastor Moody]], he disappeared six months after the photograph of the original Order was taken. His body was never found and he was presumed dead.<ref name="OOTP9">{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al skills''': To be a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], it is highly likely that Caradoc was a talented wizard and most likely used his magical ability in a number of battles against the [[Death Eaters]] before his untimely death.<ref name="OOTP9" />

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Caradoc|Caradoc]], sometimes known as ''Caradog'', was one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legend.
