==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I'm half-and-half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.|Seamus|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}Being [[Ireland|Irish]],<ref name="Irish"/> she presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], likely being [[sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="House"/> She was a fan of [[Quidditch]], supporting the [[Irish National Quidditch team]].<ref name="GoF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>

She met and fell in love with [[Seamus Finnigan's father|Mr Finnigan]], a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], marrying him without telling him that she was a [[wizardkind|witch]]. At some point after the Finnigans' wedding, she told him that she was a witch, which proved a "nasty shock" to him.<ref name="Half"/> They had a [[half-blood]] son named [[Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]], who went on to study at Hogwarts.

Mrs Finnigan told Seamus that [[ghoul]]s were scarier than they were dangerous.<ref name="Ghoul">{{POA|G}} - '''Seamus Finnigan''': Me mam says that ghouls are more scary than dangerous. </ref>

===1994===
{{Dialogue a-b|Ron Weasley|Harry wouldn't do that — we met your mother, we liked her...|Harry Potter|That's before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me!|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Harry Potter]] on Mrs Finnigan|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}Mrs Finnigan took Seamus and his friend, [[Dean Thomas]], to [[Roberts]]'s [[Quidditch World Cup Campsite|campsite]] to watch the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] final between [[Irish National Quidditch team|Ireland]] and [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team|Bulgaria]]. The Finnigans' tent was covered in shamrocks, and located near several similarly-decorated ones.<ref name="Tents">{{GOF|B|7}} - "''They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth.''</ref> The [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was displeased with the decoration,<ref name="Ministry">{{GOF|B|7}} - '''Seamus Finnigan''': Like the decorations? The Ministry's not too happy.</ref> but Mrs Finnigan believed that they had the right to show their colours, pointing out the [[Viktor Krum]] posters being hung by the supporters of [[Bulgaria]].<ref name="Irish"/>

At the campsite, Mrs Finnigan met [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]], though it is unknown if she knew who Harry was at the time. She asked the trio if they were supporting Ireland, eyeing them beadily before their confirmation.

===1995===
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Harry Potter|Just read the Daily Prophet like your mother, why don’t you?

She did not want Seamus to return to the school that year as a result, believing that Dumbledore was incapable of acting as [[headmaster]].<ref name="OotP11">{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref> However, she relented, and allowed him to.

===1996===
{{Quote|I just wanted to say, I believe you. And I've sent a copy of that magazine to me mam.|Seamus to Harry|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}Seamus sent a copy of ''[[The Quibbler]]'' to his mother in [[1996]] to sway her into believing Harry over ''The Daily Prophet''.

===1997===
{{Quote|Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral.

However, he refused, leading to a loud argument between them in the [[Entrance Hall]] before she agreed to allow him to stay for the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]]. Mrs Finnigan encountered considerable difficulty finding somewhere to stay in [[Hogsmeade]], due to the large amount of witches and wizards wishing to attend the funeral.<ref name="Funeral">{{HBP|B|30}} - "''Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral.

When [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] made Hogwarts attendance compulsory after [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|he took over the Ministry]], Mrs Finnigan was forced to send Seamus to school for the [[1997-1998 school year]].

It is unknown whether Voldemort's control of the Ministry affected Irish wizards as strongly as it affected English, Scottish, and Welsh wizards, but if it did, Mrs Finnigan might have been under suspicion for her marriage to a muggle and her son's participation in [[Dumbledore's Army]].

==Physical description==
{{Quote|He was sitting in front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to be his mother ''[...]'' |Description|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}Mrs Finnigan was a white woman with sandy-coloured hair, much like her son's.<ref name="Hair"/>
==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|You don't know my mother, she'd weasel anything out of anyone!|Seamus on his mother|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}Mrs Finnigan was said to be able to shiftily manipulate others into giving out information.<ref name="Weasel">{{OOTP}} - '''Seamus Finnigan''': You don’t know my mother, she'd weasel anything out of anyone!</ref> She was likeable and worried for her son, not wanting him to stay at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] while under the impression that [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] was unstable or after the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].<ref name="Funeral"/> [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] noted that telling Mrs Finnigan that he was anything but an [[Irish National Quidditch team|Ireland]] fan would not have ended well for him.<ref name="GoF7"/>
==Behind the scenes==
*Given [[Fergus]]'s magical ability, it is likely that he was related by blood to Mrs Finnigan, which would mean that she had at least one sibling.
