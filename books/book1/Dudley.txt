'''Mr Dudley''' may have been a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked in the [[Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes]]. When [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] were caught by [[Snatchers]] in [[1998]], Harry quickly invented the pseudonym Vernon Dudley to conceal his identity, combining the first names of his [[Vernon Dursley|uncle]] and [[Dudley Dursley|cousin]]. Pressed for the identity of his father by [[Scabior]], one of the Snatchers, Harry claimed to be the son of a wizard who worked in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. Scabior responded to this by stating that he believed someone named Dudley actually worked in that department.<ref name="DH23">{{DH|B|23}}</ref>
