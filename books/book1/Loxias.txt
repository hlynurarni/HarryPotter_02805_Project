'''Loxias''' was a [[Dark wizard]] who became Master of the [[Elder Wand]] after he murdered [[Barnabas Deverill]]. Loxias gave it the name of ''"[[Elder Wand|the Deathstick]]"'', and used it to vanquish his enemies. It is unknown who killed him, as—according to Dumbledore—many claimed to have finished him off, including [[Loxias's mother|his own mother]],<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|E}} - ''[[Albus Dumbledore]] on "''The Tale of the Three Brothers''"''</ref> but from [[Xenophilius Lovegood]]'s understanding of history, either [[Arcus]] or [[Livius]] seems to have done it, and thus became the next master of the Elder Wand.<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref>
