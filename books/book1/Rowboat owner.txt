The '''rowboat owner''' was a toothless old [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]. In [[1991]], he lent his [[Toothless old man's rowboat|rowboat]] to [[Vernon Dursley]], so that the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] and [[Harry Potter]] could get to the [[Hut-on-the-Rock|hut placed on a rock off the sea coast]], and subsequently spend the night there.<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref> They needed to do so, because Vernon and [[Petunia Dursley]] wanted to escape the grasp of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. But they were unsuccessful, as [[Rubeus Hagrid]] appeared and personally delivered Harry's letter.<ref name="PS4">{{PS|B|4}}</ref> It is uncertain whether he returned for the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]], or they returned to the mainland on some other transportation.
