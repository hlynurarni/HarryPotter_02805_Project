'''Will''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who stole some [[toad]]s belonging to [[Warty Harris]]. The toads were in turn stolen from him by [[Mundungus Fletcher]]. Will saw Mundungus with the toads later on, and, unaware that Mundungus was behind the theft, complained about how "his" toads had been taken. Mundungus offered to sell the toads he had to Will for an exorbitant price and Will agreed.<ref name="OOTP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref>
