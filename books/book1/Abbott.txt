'''Abbott''' was buried in the cemetery at [[Godric's Hollow]]. They were a possible ancestor of [[Hannah Abbott]], since wizarding families tended to live close together in certain villages after the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] was effected in [[1689]]. Harry noticed Abbott's tombstone while searching for [[Potter family|his parents']] own in the Godric's Hollow graveyard on [[24 December|Christmas Eve]] of [[1997]].<ref>{{DH}}</ref>

Abbott was part of the Abbott family, which was one of the [[pure-blood]] families listed in the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] directory in the [[1930s]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref> However, Abbott's actual blood-status was unknown and may have been a [[half-blood]] individual within the pure-blood family, like some Malfoys, or even a [[Non-magic people|muggle]] or [[muggle-born]] that was not acknowledged or joined the family after the publication of the Sacred Twenty-Eight directory.<ref>{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>
