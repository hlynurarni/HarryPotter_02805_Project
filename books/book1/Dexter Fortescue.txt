'''Professor Dexter Fortescue''' was a [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Not much is known about his time at Hogwarts.<ref name="OP27" />

==Biography==
===As Headmaster of Hogwarts===
Dexter Fortescue was made [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in an unknown time period, certainly sometime after the early [[18th century]].<ref name="Ministry"/> After his death, his portrait was hung at the [[Headmaster's office]], in order to offer advice to the current Head.<ref name="OP27" />

===Post-mortem===
In his lifetime, Professor Fortescue had at least one child. His surname lived on to the [[1990s]], in the person of [[Florean Fortescue]], his direct descendant, who ran [[Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour]] in [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="PM" />

====1995====
{{Quote|Insubordination, sir! Dereliction of duty!|Fortescue to [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}Shortly after [[Arthur Weasley]] was attacked by [[Nagini]] at the [[Department of Mysteries]], in [[1995]], Professor [[Albus Dumbledore]] attempted to wake up the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]], to tell [[Sirius Black]] that [[Harry Potter]] and the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] children were going to [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. As Phineas expressed unwillingness to help, the portrait of Dexter Fortescue was particularly vocal, as was [[Armando Dippet]] and a portrait of an [[Gimlet-eyed Hogwarts Headmistress|unidentified female Head]].<ref name="OP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

{{Quote|Blatant corruption! The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day, no sir, they did not!|Fortescue to [[Cornelius Fudge]] and [[Dolores Umbridge]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

In [[1995]], he roared his disapproval at [[Cornelius Fudge]] and [[Dolores Umbridge]] when the latter explained to the former how she had learned of the first meeting of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in the [[Hog's Head]]. She explained that [[Willy Widdershins]] had been there and had reported back. [[Minerva McGonagall]], also present, commented that she had wondered how Willy had gotten off so lightly after all those [[Regurgitating Toilet|regurgitating toilets]], and Fortescue erupted, saying that they did not cut deals with petty criminals in his day.<ref name="OP27" />

====1998====
When [[Harry Potter]] went to the [[Headmaster's office]], shortly after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Voldemort's Last Stand|defeat]] and the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]], Fortescue joined the ovation made by the previous [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Headmaster portraits|Headmaster]], waving him his ear trumpet.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Fortescue believed in honour and duty, reprimanding Phineas Nigellus for "dereliction of duty" and bellowing at Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, [[John Dawlish]], and [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] for cutting deals with petty criminals.<ref name="OP27" />

In life, he was hard of hearing, necessitating the use of an ear trumpet before his death, a trait passed along to his portrait self who is seen using it to listen to private conversations in the Headmaster's office and speaking loudly when addressing observers or other portraits.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has confirmed on {{PM}} that [[Florean Fortescue]], who ran an [[Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour|ice cream parlour]] in [[Diagon Alley]], is one of his descendants.<ref name="PM" />

==Etymology==
The name "Dexter" comes from an occupational surname meaning "one who dyes" in Old English. It also coincides with the Latin word ''dexter'' meaning "right-handed, skilled".
