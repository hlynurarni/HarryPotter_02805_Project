'''Livius''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. It is debated whether it was he who became the Master of the [[Elder Wand]] after [[Loxias]]'s death, or if it was [[Arcus]].<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Livius" comes from a Roman family name which may be related to either Latin ''liveo'' "to envy" or ''lividus'' "blue, envious". Titus Livius, also known as Livy, was a Roman historian who wrote a history of the city of [[Rome]].
