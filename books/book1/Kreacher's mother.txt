{{Quote|His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother. Is that normal, Hermione?|[[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] describes Kreacher's ultimate ambition to [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

The '''mother''' of Kreacher served as the [[house-elf]] of the [[House of Black|Black family]] sometime before her son. When she became too old to carry a tea tray, she was beheaded, and her head was mounted on a plaque and hung on the wall above the front hall stairs at [[12 Grimmauld Place]] just like all of the other house-elves that used to serve the Blacks. It was once Kreacher's sincere wish to suffer the same fate as his mother.<ref name="OOTP4">{{OOTP|B|4}}</ref>

Many house-elves met their demise through the gruesome tradition which [[Elladora Black]] began. All of their heads were described as having a snout-like nose like Kreacher. This implies that Kreacher's family served the Blacks for several generations.
