{{Quote|Kendra was a fine woman.|[[Elphias Doge]] regarding Kendra's character|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

'''Kendra Dumbledore''' (c. [[1851]]<ref name="birth" /> – Summer [[1899]]<ref name="death" />) was a [[Muggle-born]]<ref name="blood"/> [[wizardkind|witch]], the wife of [[Percival Dumbledore]]. She was also the mother of [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]], [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Ariana Dumbledore]]. When her daughter Ariana was fourteen years old she lost control of her magic, causing an explosion that killed Kendra.<ref name="death">{{DH|B|28}} - "“Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there,” said Ab-erforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . . it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was killed.”"</ref> After her death Albus (her oldest son) was left to care for his younger siblings.

==Biography==
{{Dialogue|Muriel|...a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise —|Elphias Doge|She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman.|[[Muriel]] gossiping about the Dumbledores|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
After her daughter was attacked by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] boys who saw her perform magic, Kendra moved the family to [[Godric's Hollow]], while her husband was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for taking revenge upon the Muggles who hurt [[Ariana Dumbledore]]. [[Percival Dumbledore]] did not reveal his reasons to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], and both he and Kendra kept the attack a secret, out of fear that Ariana would be considered a threat to the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] and confined to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]], as the attack left the young witch mentally disturbed and unable to control her magic.

While her husband was imprisoned and her sons attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Kendra took care of Ariana. Rumours, spread by people such as Muriel and her cousin [[Lancelot (Healer)|Lancelot]], suggested that Kendra was keeping her "[[Squib]]" daughter locked up in a cellar. When Ariana was fourteen years old, she lost control of her magic, and the explosion killed Kendra.<ref name="death" />

After Kendra's death, the cause of which "''nobody ever seemed sure''" (according to Muriel), Ariana was taken care of by her older brother [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]]. She was eventually killed in a three-way [[Duelling|duel]] between Albus, [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]], and [[Gellert Grindelwald]].

==Physical appearance==
Kendra had jet black hair which she tended to wear in a high bun, dark eyes, high cheekbones, and a straight nose. [[Harry Potter]], upon seeing a photograph of her, thought she looked [[Native Americans|Native American]], possibly indicating her heritage. He also thought her face had a "carved quality", and noted her expression as being "formally composed".

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how we grew up...|The manner in which Kendra raised her children|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
Little is known about Kendra Dumbledore, but much was said about her in gossip. [[Muriel]] deemed her a proud, terrifying woman who cared a great deal for her reputation and pretended not to be [[Muggle-born]], apparently aspiring to higher social status. However, Muriel gossiped maliciously about many people, thus her opinion is not necessarily near to the truth. Statements made by her son [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] suggest that Kendra made keeping the secret of her daughter's condition her priority, and was strict with her children about following her example. She seems to have kept herself isolated from other people. Given her manner of death and Aberforth's claim that he was able to get Ariana to eat and to calm down when Kendra could not, she may have had a difficult relationship with her daughter, as well as her sons.

==Relationships==
===Family===
{{Quote|...my father went after the bastards that did it, and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St Mungo's for good... We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.|The Dumbledore family's latter life|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}[[File:Ariana_Dumbledore_Hog's_Head.jpg|211x211px|thumb|left|Ariana, her only daughter]]
Kendra was devastated by her daughter's attack. [[Percival Dumbledore]], her husband, retaliated against the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] boys who assaulted Ariana, and was sent to [[Azkaban]]. He never told the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] his reasons, knowing that if her condition were discovered, Ariana would be permanently confined to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] as a threat to the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]]. To maintain this secrecy, Kendra moved her family to [[Godric's Hollow]] and looked after Ariana. However, they may not have been very close, as Ariana's brother [[Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] was the only one able to keep her calm. Eventually, Ariana accidentally killed her mother in an explosion of uncontrollable [[magic]].<ref name="DH28">{{DH|B|28}}</ref>

Kendra's relationship with her two sons, [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] and [[Aberforth Dumbledore]], is largely unknown. She read ''[[The Warlock's Hairy Heart]]'' from {{TBB}} to Albus at least, implying she at least tried to have a good relationship with them. However, while he was devastated by his mother's death, Aberforth resented her secretive nature and bitterly stated that they learnt lies and secrets from her. When Albus looked into the [[Mirror of Erised]], he saw his family alive and whole, showing that even if Kendra's relationship with Albus was not so good, altough it can be assumed to be better than the one she had with Aberforth and despite being bitter at her mother for dying and leaving him as head of the family, Albus still loved her truly.

==Etymology==
*[[Wikipedia:Kendra|Kendra]] is a name of disputed origin. It may come from Anglo-Saxon meaning "understanding, knowledge". It may be a variation of the English name ''Kenda'', meaning "[[water]] baby", or ''Dakota'', meaning "magical power". Alternatively, it may come from the name ''Kendrick'', which is either derived from Welsh for "greatest champion" or Anglo-Saxon for "family ruler".

==Behind the scenes==
*{{HPFW}} and {{DH|G1}} incorrectly states Kendra's death date as [[18 November]].
*In a ''[[The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore]]'' prop for [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|the first part of the film adaptation]] of {{DH}}, Kendra's name is poorly transcribed as "Canard".<ref>See [http://www.mugglenet.com/viewer/?image_location=/movie7/books/page_lifeandlies.jpg this image].</ref>
*The epitaph on Kendra and [[Ariana Dumbledore]]'s gravestone, which was made of [[granite]], as recorded in {{DH}} is Matthew 6:21 from the Christian Bible: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." This epitaph, chosen by Dumbledore, is curiously similar to the function of one of [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s inventions, the [[Deluminator]].
*If Kendra was in fact Native American, she may have studied magic at [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]].
