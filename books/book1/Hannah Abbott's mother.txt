{{Quote|There had been a horrible incident the day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen Hannah since.|News of Mrs Abbott's death|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Mrs Abbott''' (d. [[1996]]) was the mother of [[Hufflepuff]] student [[Hannah Abbott]]. During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Mrs Abbott was found dead in her home. She was murdered by [[Death Eaters]], followers of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. When Hannah was informed of this during a [[sixth year]] [[Herbology]] class, she was removed from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Mrs Abbott may have been a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] or [[Muggle-born]], as the Abbott family is a known [[pure-blood]] family yet Hannah was a [[half-blood]], which would explain why she was killed by Death Eaters. However, it is possible that it was instead one of Hannah's grandparents that had the Muggle ancestry.
**Alternatively, she may have been a supporter of Muggles or refused to assist the Death Eaters.
