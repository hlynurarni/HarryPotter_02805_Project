==Biography==
Born to a witch [[Bowman Wright's mother|mother]] and a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Bowman Wright's father|father]], he invented the [[Golden Snitch]] as a replacement for the endangered [[Golden Snidget]], combining his interest in [[science]], [[magic]], and sports.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref><ref name="QTAR">{{QTA}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Being a professional [[Metal charmer]], Bowman was highly gifted and skilful with charm-work, as he was the inventor of the famous [[Golden Snitch]], a [[magic]]al [[Levitation|flying]] object used in [[Quidditch]], casting the necessary charms needed to both craft and enchant the Snitch, which continued to last long after his death, showing his superb proficiency in this field of [[magic]].

==Etymology==
The English "wright" is a word referring to a skilled craftsman.

==Behind the scenes==
*The dates given for Bowman's birth and death on his Famous Wizard Card (1492-1560) do not agree with the timeframe laid down in {{QTA|R}}, which would indicate that he was alive towards the end of the [[1300s]].
*Bowman shares the same last name as [[Bonnie Wright]], who portrays [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] in the ''Harry Potter'' films. Incidentally, Bonnie Wright's parents, Gary Wright and Sheila Teague, are both jewellers.
