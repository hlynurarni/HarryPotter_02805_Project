The '''Riddles' cook''' (fl. [[1943]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman who served as a cook in the [[Riddle House]], before her [[Riddle family|masters]] were murdered.<ref name="GOF1"/>

==Biography==
===Cook for the Riddles===
This woman served the [[Riddle family]] in the capacity of a cook. She probably lived in the [[Riddle House]] along with other employees. She tried many times to get acquainted with fellow employee [[Frank Bryce]], but the man turned her down, preferring solitary work.<ref name="GOF1">{{GOF|B|1}}</ref>

===The Riddle Murders===
Many town residents gathered at [[The Hanged Man]] to gossip on the night the [[Riddle family|Riddles]] were murdered in [[1943]]. It was her who brought the news about the arrest of the Riddles' gardener, [[Frank Bryce]], after quite a dramatic entrance, and was subsequently bought more and more [[Sherry|sherries]] by the pub patrons, eager to hear more. She suspected Bryce did it, pointing out how easily he could have done it, since he had a set of spare keys to the [[Riddle House|house]], and there was no evidence of a forceful entry.<ref name="GOF1"/>
