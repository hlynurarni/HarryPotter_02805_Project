{{Quote|Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes…|[[Alastor Moody]] regarding the Prewett brothers deaths|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
'''Fabian Prewett''' (d. [[1981]]) was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the brother of both [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]] and [[Molly Weasley|Molly]]. Fabian was a member of the original [[Order of the Phoenix]]. He fought in the [[First Wizarding War]] and was murdered by five [[Death Eaters]] before the war's end, along with his brother.<ref name="OOTP9"/>

==Biography==
Fabian was born into the wizarding [[Prewett family]], with two known siblings: [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]] and [[Molly Weasley|Molly]]. During the [[First Wizarding War]], his sister [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] married [[Arthur Weasley]], and the couple eventually had seven children. Fabian also may have had a big nose.<ref>[http://e-card.51.net/movie.scripts/Harry.Potter/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.htm| Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (script)]: Fred states that George's nose looks "positively massive" and is corrected that it is his - he says it is a family trait from Molly, implying that Gideon and Fabian may have had a big nose too.</ref>

During the [[First Wizarding War]], Fabian and his brother decided to join the ranks of the [[Order of the Phoenix]] to fight against [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="OOTP9"/>

Eventually, however, Fabian and Gideon were attacked by five Death Eaters, one of whom was [[Antonin Dolohov]]. They were described as having "''fought like heroes''" by fellow Order member [[Alastor Moody|Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody]], though both were ultimately killed. Following Voldemort's fall from power, Dolohov, and perhaps others involved in the Prewetts' "brutal" murders, were imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for the crime.<ref name="OOTP9">{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref>

===Post-mortem===
It is unknown how Molly responded to her brother's deaths, but she was most likely heartbroken, given how much she loved her family. She often spoke fondly of them to others.

In [[1997]], Molly gave Fabian's [[Fabian Prewett's watch|gold watch]] to [[Harry Potter]] on his [[Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday party|seventeenth birthday]], as it was traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age. Harry treasured and preserved it throughout the [[Second Wizarding War]], keeping it and wearing it well into his thirties. She also stated that Fabian was not "terribly careful" with his possessions, especially his watch, which he dented. Unlike normal watches, it had stars as the clock's hands.<ref name="DH7">{{DH|B|7}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Along with his brother [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]], Fabian was a highly-respected member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], implying that he was proficient in many areas of magic. [[Alastor Moody]] noted that it took five [[Death Eaters]], including the particularly sadistic [[Antonin Dolohov]], to kill Fabian and his brother.<ref name="OOTP9"/>
==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Fabian|Fabian]] is the English form of the Latin ''Fabianus'', which was the name given to emancipated slaves in Rome. It is derived from ''Fabius'', the name of a very influential Roman patrician family, whose members included many politicians and soldiers. The most notable of the Fabian family was [[Wikipedia:Fabius Maximus|Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]], who was given the epithet ''Cunctator'', "the Delayer", because of the unorthodox strategies he employed in the Second Punic War against Hannibal. He developed the Fabian strategy of warfare.

==Behind the scenes==
*While Fabian and Gideon are mentioned as having been members of the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]], their sister [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] was not, most likely because she was raising her children, Fabian's nephews, during the [[First Wizarding War]].
*It is possible Fabian's [[Molly Weasley|sister]] honoured Fabian and Gideon with the naming of her twin sons. [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], one of her twins, has the same first initial as Fabian, 'F'. Her other son, [[George Weasley|George]], has the same initial 'G'. Gideon and Fabian may also have been twins themselves, though it has yet to be confirmed or denied. It is widely believed that since twins run in families this increases the odds, however identical twins, such as Fred and George, do not run in families so in reality this gives no extra weight to the theory.
