This '''portrait of a Healer''' was hanging in the fourth floor in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. He diagnosed [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] with [[Spattergroit]] during a visit to the hospital on [[Christmas]] in [[1995]], given the "unsightly blemishes" on his skin that would leave him uglier than he already was. The portrait suggested that Ron "take the liver of a [[toad]], bind it tight about his throat and stand naked by the full [[moon]] in a barrel of [[Eel eye|eels' eyes]]". Ron took this diagnosis as a great offence, and countered that they were only freckles.<ref>{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>
