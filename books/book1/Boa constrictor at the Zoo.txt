This '''boa constrictor''' was a large male brown [[snake]] that lived at the [[Zoo]]. It escaped after the glass on its enclosure [[Vanishment|vanished]].<ref name="PS2">{{PS|B|2}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:HarryParseltongue.png|250px|thumb|[[Harry Potter]] talks to the snake]]
This snake was bred in captivity sometime before [[1991]] when it was on display. This changed in June [[1991]]. After Dudley saw the snake and became uninterested, the snake came in contact with [[Harry Potter]], a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]], who spoke to it. During the course of their conversation, he [[underage magic|accidentally vanished]] the glass in front of its enclosure. The snake slithered free, leading Dudley to think it was after him. The freed boa briefly thanked Harry and told him that it was going to [[Brazil]], the native range of its [[boa constrictor|species]]. From there, the snake calmly slithered out of the reptile house.<ref name="PS2" /> It is unknown if it eventually made it to Brazil or that it was possibly re-captured and put back into captivity.

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Python.png|250px|thumb|The [[snake]]]]
Lonely and bored, the snake found it highly annoying to have zoo visitors tap on the tank's glass front every day. He had also always dreamed of living in Brazil. He also had a rather playful side, as he made a point of snapping at the heels of panicking Muggles as he left his former prison but without intent to hurt them.<ref name="PS2" />

Interestingly, the snake seemed to be capable of reading; when Harry asked if it missed its family in Brazil, it pointed to a sign which read "''RAISED IN CAPTIVITY''".<ref name="PS2" />

==Behind the scenes==
*In both the book and in {{PS|FA}}, the snake winks at Harry. In real life, snakes are unable to wink, as they have no eyelids.
*In the film, the boa constrictor was replaced by a Burmese [[python]].
*The boa constrictor was rumoured to actually be [[Nagini]]. This has since been proven false, as Nagini is female, while the Snake at the Zoo was male, and has now been confirmed by J.K Rowling on Twitter.<ref>https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1044578644604198913</ref>
