'''Hereward''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who mastered the [[Elder Wand]] after killing his own [[Godelot|father]] to acquire it.<ref>{{DH|B|21}}</ref> He succeeded in doing this by locking him in his own cellar to die, after stealing [[Elder Wand|his wand]].<ref>{{TBB|E}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "''The Tale of the Three Brothers''"''</ref>

It's unknown what Hereward did after obtaining the wand. He ultimately lost possession of the Elder Wand at some point, presumably by being defeated in a duel, killed, or disarmed.

==Etymology==
The name "Hereward" is derived from the Old English elements ''here'' "army" and ''weard'' "guard", from which the magial kind of "ward" (as a protection) is also derived. This was the name of an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon leader who rebelled against Norman rule.
