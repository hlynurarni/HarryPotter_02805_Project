==History==
[[File:Harry-potter1-boats.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Hagrid and first years sailing on boats]]
Every school year at Hogwarts, after the [[Hogwarts Express]] arrives at [[Hogsmeade station]], [[Rubeus Hagrid]] (or a substitute) calls the [[first year]] students to follow him to the lake shore and the [[Hogwarts boats]]. Whereupon Hagrid occupies one boat and each other boat carries up to four students. The boats then self-propels across the lake to a dock under [[Hogwarts Castle]] as per tradition.<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> At the start of the [[1994–1995 school year]], first year [[Dennis Creevey]] said he fell into the lake and the [[Hogwarts Giant Squid|Giant Squid]] pushed him back into a boat.<ref name="GOF12">{{GOF|B|12}}</ref>

Upon reaching the castle, Hagrid and the first years disembark and climb the stairs to the lawn, entering the castle through the front doors. First years then waited until summoned into the Great Hall to get [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into their houses.<ref name="PS7" /> At the end of their first year, students take the boats back to Hogsmeade Station,<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref> while most older students ride down the lane in carriages.<ref name="OOTP10">{{OOTP|B|10}}</ref>

At the end of every school year, graduating [[seventh year]]s leave the school by [[Graduation ceremony|sailing back across the lake]].<ref name="accio">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html 2007 PotterCast Interview]</ref> 

===[[Attack at the Great Lake|Saving the innocent]]===
[[File:Dementors Black Lake.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Harry conjuring a Patronus]]
On [[6 June]] [[1994]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Sirius Black]] were attacked by [[Dementor]]s on the shore of the lake. Harry tried to protect them by using [[Patronus Charm]], but he did not succeed. Before he fainted he suddenly saw a person conjuring a corporeal Patronus on the opposite side of the lake.<ref name="POA20">{{POA|B|20}}</ref> Later that night, after using Hermione's [[Time-Turner]] in [[Hospital Wing]], they went back in time to save Black. Harry circled the lake and waited for the Dementors. Watching the events, he realised that he earlier saw himself and conjured a corporeal Patronus in deer form to flush the Dementors.<ref name="POA21">{{POA|B|21}}</ref>

===[[Triwizard Tournament]]===
[[File:Second Task Lake.JPG|236x236px|thumb|The [[Triwizard Tournament#The Second Task|Second Task]] of the Triwizard Tournament]]

Students from [[Durmstrang Institute]] arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] on their enchanted boat via the Great Lake. As part of the Second Task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]], the four champions [[Harry Potter]], [[Fleur Delacour]], and [[Cedric Diggory]], and [[Viktor Krum]] had to swim in the lake for one hour to rescue something that was taken from them. Harry used [[Gillyweed]] to be able to breath underwater, while Cedric and Fleur used the [[Bubble-Head Charm]], and Krum partially [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] himself into a shark.<ref name="GOF26">{{GOF|B|26}}</ref>

===[[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's Funeral]]===
[[File:Image14.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|White Tomb, Albus Dumbledore's resting place]]
In [[1997]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] was laid to rest in a [[White Tomb|white tomb]] on the shores of the lake following his death in the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]].<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>

===Trevor's escape===
At some point in his life, [[Trevor]] managed to escape from [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] and into the lake. Both pet and owner felt a sense of relief at this.<ref name="toads">{{WW|toads}} (transcript available [http://archive.is/20130109112545/pottermorespoilers.tumblr.com/post/9725039703/history-toads here])</ref>

==Description==
===Inhabitants===
[[File:B4C26M1_Great_Lake_Merpeople_second_task.png|200px|thumb|The [[Merpeople village]] in the Great Lake]]
The grounds of Hogwarts function partly as a nature reserve for magical creatures which have difficulty existing in Muggle-inhabited areas. There are [[Grindylow]]s (vicious little [[water demon]]s), [[Selkie]]s (of a hardy Scottish strain)<ref name="GOF26" /> and a [[Hogwarts Giant Squid|giant squid]], which is semi-domesticated and permits students to tickle its tentacles on sunny days, when it basks in the shallows.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref> The lake has a [[Bowtruckle Island]].<ref name="COG">{{COG|S|70}}</ref>

===Temperature===
The lake is often said to be very cold, but [[Viktor Krum]] was known to have swam in it, wearing nothing but swimming trunks, apparently not affected by the low temperature (although this was probably due to the fact that his school, [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], is located in a place that is even colder).<ref name="GOF24">{{GOF|B|24}}</ref>

[[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] and her friends were also said to dangle their legs over the water, which could mean that there were no rules whilst they were in school against swimming in the lake.<ref name="OOTP28">{{OOTP|B|28}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter films]], the Great Lake is portrayed by {{wplink|Loch Shiel}}.<ref name="wiki">{{wikilink|Loch Shiel}}</ref>
*In the films, the lake is known as "The Black Lake."
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, the lake has quays.
*In the films, Dumbledore's body is placed on a small island in the middle of the Great Lake. After this, in [[1998]], Voldemort accesses [[White Tomb|Dumbledore's grave]] and takes the [[Elder Wand]] from it. It is possible that the island was first seen in in {{POA|FA}}.
*In an early draft of {{COS}}, [[J. K. Rowling|J.K.Rowling]] planned to have Harry and Ron crash [[Flying Ford Anglia|the car]] into the lake and be introduced to the merpeople at that point.<ref name="PM">{{PM}}</ref>
*Although most likely a coincidence, Lily's character token in {{LEGO|Y2}} is collected in the lake after swimming in a floaty by following a path of studs. 

===Author's comments===
"''The lake is the setting for the second task that the Triwizard competitors must face in Goblet of Fire, which is also my favourite task. I find it satisfyingly creepy; I like the diversity of the methods employed by the competitors to breathe underwater, and I enjoyed plumbing the depths of a part of the grounds that had never been seen before. In the original draft of Chamber of Secrets, I had Harry and Ron crash into the lake in Mr Weasley's Ford Anglia, and meet the merpeople there for the first time. At that time I had a vague notion that the lake might lead to other places, and that the merpeople might play a larger role in the later books than they did, so I thought that Harry ought to be introduced to both at this stage. However, the Whomping Willow provided a more satisfying, less distracting crash, and served a later purpose in Prisoner of Azkaban, too. The Great Lake (which is really a Scottish loch, apparently freshwater and landlocked) never did develop as a portal to other seas or rivers, although the appearance of the Durmstrang ship from its depths in Goblet of Fire hints at the fact that if you are travelling by an enchanted craft, you might be able to take a magical shortcut to other waterways.''"
