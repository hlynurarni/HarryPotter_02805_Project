{{Dialogue a-b-c|Hermione|Well, we need three.|Ginny|Four, Hermione.|Luna|I think there are six of us, actually.|[[Hermione Granger]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], and [[Luna Lovegood]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}

These '''Thestrals''' were part of the [[Hogwarts Thestral herd|Hogwarts Thestral Herd]]; they were used by [[Dumbledore's Army]] to ride to the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters|Ministry of Magic]] on [[17 June]], [[1996]] after Harry had a dream about [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] [[Cruciatus Curse|torturing]] [[Sirius Black]].

==Biography==
The Thestrals were either introduced or born into the [[Forbidden Forest]] and the herd of [[Thestral]]s already existing therein. As they were adults, it is likely that they had lived in the Forest for some time.

On [[17 June]], [[1996]], [[Harry Potter]] had a dream about [[Sirius Black]] being tortured by Lord Voldemort in the [[Department of Mysteries]];<ref name="OOTP31">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref> [[Dolores Umbridge]] caught him and [[Hermione Granger]] in the [[fire]] talking to [[Kreacher]] at [[12 Grimmauld Place]],<ref name="OOTP32">{{OOTP|B|32}}</ref> but Hermione led the pair into the Forest, where the [[centaur]] colony drew [[Dolores Umbridge]] away and, when [[Grawp]] the [[giant]] assaulted them, they fired arrows at him, peppering the ground and those on it with [[blood]].<ref name="OOTP33">{{OOTP|B|33}}</ref>

[[Luna Lovegood]], [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who had been captured by Umbridge's [[Inquisitorial Squad]], met them in the Forest. The Thestrals, drawn to them by the giant [[blood]] soaking Harry and Hermione, offered a method of transport on which they could get to [[London]] and thus to the Ministry.<ref name="OOTP33"/>

After several hours riding, the Thestrals finally reached their destination, and began scavenging for food in the rubbish bins outside the Ministry.<ref name="OOTP34">{{OOTP|B|34}}</ref> It can be presumed that they returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible the Thestrals stayed outside the Ministry until Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna emerged and then carried them back to the school, although it is equally likely that the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]] members who had fought in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] [[Apparition|Apparated]] the students back to school.
