'''Abraxas Malfoy''' (fl. [[1954]]-[[1968]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], a member of the [[Malfoy family]], father of [[Lucius Malfoy]], grandfather of [[Draco Malfoy]] and great-grandfather of [[Scorpius Malfoy]]. He was related by marriage to the [[House of Black|Blacks]], through his daughter-in-law [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], and, more distantly, to the [[Lestrange family|Lestranges]].

==Biography==
{{dialogue a-b|Draco Malfoy |Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?|Horace Slughorn|Yes. I was sorry to hear he had died, although of course it wasn't unexpected, dragon pox at his age...|[[Draco Malfoy]] seeking favour from Horace Slughorn|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}In his youth, Abraxas attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name="PS5" /><ref name="COS9" />

Abraxas had at least one child, [[Lucius Malfoy]], who was born in late [[1953]] or [[1954]];<ref name="OP15">{{OOTP|B|15}}</ref> the fate of Lucius's mother, Abraxas's wife, is currently unknown. Abraxas apparently knew [[Horace Slughorn]], according to his grandson [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] and Slughorn himself.<ref name="HBP9">{{HBP|B|9}}</ref>

Abraxas Malfoy was widely believed to have been part of the shady plot that, in [[1968]], forced [[Minister for Magic]] [[Nobby Leach]] (the first [[Muggle-born]] ever to have held the office) to leave his post prematurely. Nothing was, however, conclusively proven against Malfoy.<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>

Abraxas [[Death|died]] of a case of [[Dragon Pox]], a relatively common malady of the elderly, some time before September [[1996]]. [[Horace Slughorn]] knew him at one time and was sorry to hear that he had passed away, as he informed Abraxas's grandson [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]].<ref name="HBP9"/> Abraxas may also have been a well-respected wizard, as Draco attempted to use his name to charm Slughorn into letting Draco into the [[Slug Club]], because Slughorn was impressed with heritage. However, perhaps due to Lucius's renewed criminal records, the name was not good enough to earn Slughorn's favour.

==Etymology==
The word ''[[Wikipedia:Abraxas|Abraxas]]'' was engraved on stones that were considered amulets in the Ancient Roman-Greco world. They often had figures carved on them as well that resembled [[basilisk]]s or [[chimaera]]s. The name may be related to the word ''abracadabra'', which is notable as this may also be the root of the [[Killing Curse]] incantation ''"Avada Kedavra"''. The name Abraxas is also mentioned in Gnostic texts, and in Ancient Egyptian mythology as a god or [[demon]].

==Behind the scenes==
*It's possible that as since Draco used his name to get Slughorn's attention Abraxas was a member of the [[Slug Club]], though this is unconfirmed.
*Interestingly his plot to remove Nobby Leach from the Ministry happened approximately two years before the [[First Wizarding War]] began. It's unknown if the two events are connected however, though the [[Death Eaters]] would have nonetheless benefited from Leach's removal.
*It is unknown if he was a Death Eater, or if he ever met Lord Voldemort.
