'''Mr Smith''' was the father of [[Zacharias Smith]]. He collected his son from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] following the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]] in [[1997]]. He did not attend the [[Funeral of Albus Dumbledore|funeral]], perhaps suggesting that he was not a supporter of Dumbledore, a concept in keeping with his son's knack for making enemies. He was described as being a haughty-looking man.<ref name="HBP30">{{HBP|B|30}}</ref>
