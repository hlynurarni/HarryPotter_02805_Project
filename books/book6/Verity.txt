She seemed to follow a chain of command; in the [[1996]] summer holidays, [[Harry Potter]] overheard her use the formal title "Mister" to address Fred and George.<ref name="HBP6">{{HBP|B|6}}</ref> When Fred and George went into hiding and closed the shop in [[Diagon Alley]], it is also possible she went into hiding if she was not already in hiding.

==Physical appearance==
Verity was young and had short blonde hair.<ref name=hair />

==Behind the scenes==
*Verity is seen very briefly during {{HBP|FA}}, she is seen moving boxes with joke products upstairs and later she is working on the shop's till dealing with customers. In the film adaptation she has long brown hair instead of short blonde like she does in the books. In the film adaptation she looks very much like a teenager. 
*It is unknown who portrayed her in the film adaptation.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}} she has white hair and white clothes. She is seen on the staircase trapped by [[Fanged Frisbee]]s, possibly [[Fanged Flyer]]s.
*Verity is given the [[love potion|love potion&nbsp;by]] [[Harry Potter]] in {{LEGO|Y2}}. 

==Etymology==
