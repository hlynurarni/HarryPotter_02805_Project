The '''niece''' of [[Great Britain]]'s [[British Prime Minister in 1996|Muggle Prime Minister]] was delighted when he gave her a pet [[gerbil]] as a gift. What her uncle hadn't told her, however, was that the gerbil had originally been a teacup, which then-[[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] had [[Teacup to gerbil spell|transformed]] to prove that he was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] during their first meeting.<ref name="HBP1">{{HBP|B|1}}</ref>
