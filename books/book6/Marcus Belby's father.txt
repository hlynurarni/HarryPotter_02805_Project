'''Mr Belby''' (fl. [[1996]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the father of [[Marcus Belby]]. He did not get along with Marcus's uncle, [[Damocles Belby|Damocles]], as he did not believe brewing [[potion]]s a worthwhile pursuit,<ref name="Potions">'''Marcus Belby''': Him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me Dad says potions are rubbish. Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day. ({{HBP|F}})</ref> and, as such, the two men had little contact.
