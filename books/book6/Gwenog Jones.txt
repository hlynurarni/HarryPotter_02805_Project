'''Gwenog Jones''' (b. [[1968]]<ref name="DOB" />) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. When Gwenog graduated from Hogwarts, she became a professional [[Quidditch]] player and later achieved fame as the captain and [[Beater]] of the [[Wales|Welsh]] all-female [[Quidditch team]], the [[Holyhead Harpies]].

==Biography==
Gwenog Jones was born into the presumably wizarding [[Jones family]] in 1968. Her family possibly came from [[Wales]] as Jones is a Welsh surname and she later become the manager of the [[Welsh National Quidditch team]].

She began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1979]] or [[1980]]. It's unknown what house she was sorted into. During her time at the school she was became a favourite student of [[Horace Slughorn]], and was consequently inducted into his [[Slug Club]] throughout her time at the school, one of the last before his retirement.<ref name="HBP4">{{HBP|B|4}}</ref>

Sometime after graduating likely in [[1986]] or [[1987]], Jones became a [[Beater]] for the all-female [[Holyhead Harpies]] [[Quidditch team]], and eventually became the Captain of said team. Remembering her former [[Potions (class)|Potions]] teacher, she gave Slughorn free tickets to her Quidditch matches whenever he so desired.<ref name="HBP4" /> Amongst Jones's biggest fans was [[Ginevra Weasley]], who had a poster of the prestigious Quidditch player on the wall of her small [[Ginevra Weasley's bedroom|bedroom]] at [[the Burrow]].<ref name="DH7">{{DH|B|7}}</ref> In later years Ginny would go on to play for the Harpies, though it is unknown whether Jones was still on the team at that point.

By [[2014]], Gwenog Jones had retired from the [[Holyhead Harpies]], and had become the manager of the Welsh National Quidditch Team. Shortly before the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], Gwenog Jones threatened to "''[[curse]] the face off''" rival [[Brazilian National Quidditch team|Brazilian]] manager [[José Barboza]], when he called her Chasers "''talentless [[hag]]s''" (a comment that he later insisted had been taken out of context). During the [[Brazil]]-[[Wales]] quarter-final match, she showed up to the game in an 'It Should Have Been [[Haiti]]' T-shirt and was prevented from entering the stadium, therefore missing the first ten minutes of the game. She later ended up in custody when, after Brazilian Seeker [[Tony Silva]] caught the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] and won the game, she attempted to curse off Barboza's face in the packed stadium and was dragged away by her own Beaters.<ref name="PM" />

==Physical appearance==
Gwenog was described as being a tall, dark-skinned witch. Due to the fact she was a beater it can be presumed that she was fairly burly or at least had a 'beater's build'. She had dark brown hair and brown eyes.<ref name="JKRS" />

==Personality and traits==
Jones had said on a number of occasions that [[Wizardkind|witches]] made better [[Quidditch]] players than [[Wizardkind|wizards]], and no one was likely to disagree with her. This was because "''people who disagreed with [Jones] had a nasty habit of turning into woodlice.''" After a game she enjoyed relaxing with friends, drinking [[butterbeer]], and listening to the [[Weird Sisters]]. [[Hermione Granger]] considered Gwenog to be "a bit full of herself" after meeting her at one of Slughorn's [[Slug Club]] meetings in 1996.<ref name="HBP14">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref> It is thought that the [[International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee|ICWQC]]'s ban on 'managerial trash talk' was made with her in mind.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Jones was evidently a highly accomplished and talented [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, given how she became both the [[Captain]] and [[Beater]] for the [[Holyhead Harpies]] Quidditch team, a very impressive achievement in the [[magic]]al sport which gained much fame and recognition in the world of Quidditch. She was so experienced in playing the sport that she eventually became the Manager of the [[Welsh National Quidditch team]]. 
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': It was said that "''people who disagreed with [Jones] had a nasty habit of turning into [[Wood louse|woodlice]]''", this meant that Jones was capable of casting a transfiguration [[spell]] which turned [[human]]s into [[Wood louse|woodlice]]. 
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Jones appeared to a level of skill with the casting of [[dark charm]]s, given how she threatened to [[curse]] [[José Barboza]] during a Quidditch match and had to be pulled away by her own players to prevent her from cursing him.<ref name="PM" />

==Etymology==
''Gwenog ''can trace back to the Welsh name ''Gwen'', which means "fair, blessed". This can relate to her being the captain of the only all-witch quidditch team. Being the only one can be considered as "blessed".

''Jones ''can refer to ''John, ''which means in Hebrew "God is gracious". This can relate to her being "blessed".
==Behind the scenes==
*Gwenog may be related to [[Hestia Jones]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], [[Peter Jones]], a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], or [[Megan Jones]], a [[Hufflepuff]] student at Hogwarts in [[Harry Potter]]'s year.
*The illustration on Gwenog's [[Wizard of the Month]] profile shows her to have dark skin and purple Quidditch robes. However, in the signed photo of Gwenog owned by [[Horace Slughorn]] in {{HBP|FA}}, she has light skin and is wearing yellow Quidditch robes.
*Although she definitely attended a party earlier in the year, it is unknown, being a former member of the Slug Club, whether or not she attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party]] in [[1996]].
