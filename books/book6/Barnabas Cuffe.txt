'''Barnabas Cuffe''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the editor-in-chief of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', working in their [[Daily Prophet's main office|main offices]] in [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="HBP4"/>

==Biography==
While studying at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Cuffe must have either been a very good student, or possibly come from money, power, or has good stories to tell, as [[Horace Slughorn]] chose Barnabas to join his [[Slug Club]]. As a child, he was very interested in the news, and enjoyed Slughorn's exaggerated outakes on the ''Daily Prophet''. He maintained a good relationship with Slughorn as he stated that Cuffe was always ready to take his [[owl]] on the day's news. He also enjoyed receiving [[vibe]]s as a means of communication.<ref name="HBP4">{{HBP|B|4}}</ref>

During Cuffe's leadership, the ''Daily Prophet'' was under a strong influence by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], which highly relied on the newspaper to assure the support of the British wizarding community.<ref name="WW">{{WW|the-daily-prophet}}</ref>

Aside from being the paper's editor, Cuffe occasionally wrote articles for the ''Prophet''. One such article, entitled "The Wizarding World in Mourning", covered the then-recent death of [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE}} (see [[:File:DumbledoreObituary.JPG|this image]])</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Barnabas" is the Greek form of an Aramaic name. In Acts in the New Testament the byname Barnabas was given to a man named Joseph, a companion of Paul on his missionary journeys. The original Aramaic is unattested, but it may be from בּר נביא (bar naviya') meaning "son of the prophet", though in Acts 4:36 it is claimed that the name means "son of encouragement". As an English name, it came into occasional use after the 12th century.
