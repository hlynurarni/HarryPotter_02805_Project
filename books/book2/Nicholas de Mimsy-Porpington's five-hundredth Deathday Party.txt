The '''five-hundredth [[Deathday Party]]''' of the [[ghost]] [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], who haunted [[Hogwarts Castle]] as the Ghost of [[Gryffindor Tower]], was a celebration thrown by said ghost, commonly called Nearly-Headless Nick, (as his head hung on by an inch of skin), to commemorate the day he died. The Party included a candlelit dinner of rancid, moulded food, the smell of which would gag a normal living [[human]].<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

The ghost orchestra playing at the Deathday Party were playing the musical saw.<ref name="COS8"/>

The [[Headless Hunt]] attended the party. They are described like "a dozen [[Ghost horse|horses]] with headless riders". There also was a game of [[Head Hockey]], by the [[Headless Hunt|Hunt]].<ref name="COS8"/>

==Background==
{{Quote|Well, this Hallowe'en will be my five-hundredth deathday.|[[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}Sir Nicholas was sentenced to death by beheading after a teeth-straightening spell went awry on a woman named [[Lady Grieve]]. Unfortunately, the executioner assigned to decapitate Nick had a blunt axe. Thus, even after forty-seven hacks into his neck, Nick's head was only partially severed. Sir Nicholas was executed on the dawn of October 31st, 1492.<ref name="background">[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=11 Extra Stuff - "Nearly Headless Nick"] on {{JKRS}}</ref> After this point, Nick returned as a ghost due to his fear of death and presumably held a deathday party every year for five centuries to mark the anniversary of the day he died.<ref name="COS8"/>

==Celebrations==
{{Quote|My dear friends. Welcome, welcome ... so glad you could come ....|Nick greeting his guests|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}[[File:Deathday.jpg|200x200px|thumb|left]]
In honour of the event, Sir Nicholas took the liberty of decorating one of the castle's [[Deathday Party Hall|roomier dungeons]] with [[Jet black candle|black candles]], which gave off a bluish glow and many black hangings. He also ordered a variety of food that had been tainted to make it stronger, and therefore more likely to be possible for ghosts to taste. This food included large, rotten fish on handsome silver platters, [[cake]]s burned charcoal-black, heaped on salvers, maggoty haggis, mouldy cheese, and, in pride of place, an enormous grey cake in the shape of a tombstone, which had his name and date of death written on it in tar-like frosting.<ref name="COS8"/>

Last but not least, Nicholas hired a ghostly orchestra to play the musical saw, and provided them with a black-draped raised platform for them to perform on.<ref name="COS8"/>

|[[Patrick Delaney-Podmore|Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore]]
|Sir Patrick, the leader of the [[Headless Hunt]], attended the party along with a group of his huntsmen. Patrick managed to offend Sir Nicholas by pointing out that he was not properly decapitated, but the other guests found him quite amusing.<ref name="COS8"/>

|-
|[[Myrtle Warren]]
|[[Myrtle Warren]] and [[Peeves]] fell out during the party, due to Peeves overhearing [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s conversation with [[Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], in which she mentioned how awful the toilet she haunted was. The argument ended in Moaning Myrtle crying and Peeves throwing [[fungus-covered peanuts]] and crying "''Spotty! Spotty!''".<ref name="COS8"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington died in [[1492]], and is celebrating his 500th deathday anniversary.

*Although this event occurred 489 years earlier, Nearly Headless Nick's deathday is on the exact day as Harry's parents death day, the 31st October.
*Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party is completely omitted from {{COS|FA}}.
