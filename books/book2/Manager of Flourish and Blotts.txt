The '''manager''' of [[Flourish and Blotts]] was a much-tired [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who took the brunt of teachers' selection of required textbooks for their classes that turned out to be somewhat exotic.

==Biography==

{{Quote|Gentleman, please-please!|The manager trying to stop [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Arthur Weasley]] fighting|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}

In [[1992]], he was first seen by [[Harry Potter]] on camera at [[Flourish and Blotts]] as he was trying to keep [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s book signing under control.<ref name="CS4">{{COS|B|4}}</ref>

===1993===
{{Quote|Stop it! Stop it!|The manager trying to stop copies of the [[The Monster Book of Monsters]] from attacking each other|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}In [[1993]], he told [[Harry Potter|Harry]] that he had once lost a lot of money on ''[[The Invisible Book of Invisibility]],'' because they never found the books. When the ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'' became one books required by students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he had to cope with the new additions to his book list attacking both each other and him; the manager spent much of that summer vowing never to stock that book again. Whenever he had to grab a copy for a customer, he would become rather unhappy due to the books' viciousness; while he was relieved that Harry already got a copy beforehand, he was on the verge of tears when [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] requested two copies total. He also recommend Harry to not buy ''[[Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the Worst is Coming]]'', as it was enough to frighten anyone to [[death]], and in general doesn't recommend reading books about death omens because one would start seeing them everywhere.<ref name="PA4">{{POA|B|4}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*As the owner of [[Flourish and Blotts]], it is possible that his name is either Flourish or Blotts. However, knowing that his shop was established in [[15th century]], he might not be an indirect descendant of the founder.
