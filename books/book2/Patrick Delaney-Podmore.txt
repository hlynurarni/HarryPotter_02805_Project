'''Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who later became a headless [[ghost]]. He was playful and charismatic, and often liked to show off in front of other ghosts. He may be related to [[Order of the Phoenix]] member [[Sturgis Podmore]].<ref name="COS8"/>

==Biography==
Little is known about Sir Patrick's life other than that he died by beheading.<ref name="COS8"/>

Sir Patrick was in charge of the [[Headless Hunt]]. He doesn't make any exceptions to the rules — a ghost must be completely headless to join. This came as a terrible blow to the ego of [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]], who was denied entrance to the Headless Hunt because his head is still attached to his body (albeit barely). Because of this rejection, Sir Nicholas mockingly called him Sir Properly-Decapitated Podmore.<ref name="COS8"/>

Sir Patrick appeared at [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party]] in [[1992]] where he stole much of Sir Nicholas' thunder by cracking jokes and making light of the sombre atmosphere.<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

The Headless Hunt fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Therefore Sir Patrick most likely defended the school the best as a ghost could.<ref name="DH31">{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:Sir Patrick.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Sir Patrick in 1992]]
The name "Patrick" comes from the Latin name ''Patricius'', which meant "nobleman". This name was adopted in the 5th-century by Saint Patrick, whose birth name was Sucat. He was a Romanized Briton who was captured and enslaved in his youth by Irish raiders. After six years of servitude he escaped home, but he eventually became a bishop and went back to Ireland as a missionary. He is traditionally credited with Christianizing the island, and is regarded as Ireland's patron saint.

==Behind the scenes==
*Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore was featured on a piece of conceptual art, by Dermot Power, for {{COS|FA}}. He was not, however, featured in the actual film.
