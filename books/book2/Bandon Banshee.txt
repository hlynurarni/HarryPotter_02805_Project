The '''[[Bandon]] Banshee''' was a [[banshee]] who was supposedly defeated by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]<ref name="CS6">{{COS|B|6}}</ref>, but it was actually defeated by a [[witch with a hairy chin]].<ref name="CS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> The book ''[[Break with a Banshee]]'' is most likely centred around this Banshee's defeat.

This achievement seemed to have been one of Lockhart's personal favourites, as he often discussed it, and when [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was speaking disdainfully of Lockhart to [[Harry Potter]] in [[1992]], he complained how Lockhart was "bangin’ on about some banshee he banished", when he visited him previously. Hagrid also correctly suspected then that Lockhart was indeed a dishonest con artist, as he stated afterwards that " If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my [[kettle]]."<ref name="COS7">{{COS|B|7}}</ref>
