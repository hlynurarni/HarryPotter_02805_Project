The most famous Whomping Willow is the [[Hogwarts Whomping Willow|one]] planted on the grounds of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="COS5">{{COS|B|5}}</ref> The Whomping Willow was planted around the year [[1971]] to cover up the opening of a secret passage leading from the Hogwarts grounds to the [[Shrieking Shack]] in the village of [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref>

It had a small knot near the base. Pressing the knot caused the tree to become immobilised.<ref name="POA17">{{POA|B|17}}</ref> This allowed [[Remus Lupin]] to travel unnoticed to and from the Shrieking Shack, where he was able to undergo his transformation into a [[Lycanthropy|werewolf]] in privacy. To access the tunnel, Lupin's friend [[Peter Pettigrew]] would transform into his rat [[animagus]] form, becoming small enough to easily avoid the willow's branches and press the knot.<ref name="POA18"/>

The willow's movements afterwards prevented Lupin from leaving while in his feral state.<ref name="POA18">{{POA|B|18}}</ref>

Students would challenge each other to get as close as possible to the tree's trunk until the tree nearly took the eye of student [[Davey Gudgeon]].<ref name="POA10"/>

During the [[1989–1990 school year]], [[Professor]] [[Pomona Sprout]] taught her [[sixth year]] [[Herbology]] students about how to care for young Whomping Willows.<ref name="HM624h">{{HM|6|24|h}}</ref>
