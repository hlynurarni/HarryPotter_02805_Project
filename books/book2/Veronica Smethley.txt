{{Quote|Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley's address.|Description.|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
'''Veronica Smethley''' was a [[wizardkind|witch]], who was a fan of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. She wrote to him at least once, in the early [[1990s]].<ref name="COS7"/>

During the course of a detention in the [[1992-1993 school year]], while Lockhart was the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], [[Harry Potter]] was tasked with helping him answer his fan mail. As he was writing out Veronica Smethley's address on an envelope, he heard a [[Serpent of Slytherin|disembodied voice]] calling "''Come… come to me… Let me rip you… Let me tear you… Let me kill you…''". Lockhart did not hear the voice, but Harry gave a huge jump on his seat and smeared a large lilac blot across the envelope and it covered her street name.<ref name="COS7">{{COS|B|7}}</ref>
