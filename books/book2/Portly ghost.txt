==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown if this ghost resided at [[Hogwarts Castle]] or if he only came there to celebrate [[Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|Sir Nicholas's Deathday]].
*If the [[knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead]] is [[Wikipedia:Harold II|Harold II]] and the [[Ghost of a ragged man wearing chains|ragged man wearing chains]] is [[Wikipedia:Jacob Marley|Jacob Marley]] and connects to the fact that Sir Nicholas served the royal family in his lifetime it could mean that Nick only invited important people, which again could mean this is [[Wikipedia:Daniel Lambert|Daniel Lambert]]; a portly man, known for his unusually large size, and who had become a popular character after his death.
