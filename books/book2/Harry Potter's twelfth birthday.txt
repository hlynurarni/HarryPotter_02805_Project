'''[[Harry Potter]]'s twelfth birthday''' was wildly ignored by his [[Vernon Dursley|uncle]], [[Petunia Dursley|aunt]], and [[Dudley Dursley|cousin]], although Dudley ''did'' remember his birthday and mocked him for it.<ref name="COS1">{{COS|B|1}}</ref> On this day, [[Dobby]] the [[house-elf]] arrived and warned Harry not to return to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. When Harry refused, Dobby took it upon himself to try and keep Harry safe, using a [[Hover Charm]] to smash a [[Petunia Dursley's pudding|pudding]] in the Dursleys' kitchen.<ref name="COS2">{{COS|B|2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
In the film version, Dobby drops the cake on the head of Mrs Mason, to the same effect as in the book.
