                From the above bar plot some interesting things can be seen:</p>
                <ol class="mb-0">
                    <li>
                        <b>Order of the Phoenix</b> is the book with the highest number of chapters and the longest chapters on average. Therefore it is not surprising that it also has the longest total text and the highest word count after the text cleanup. It is also the book with the highest number of unique word. However, when the unique word ratio count is examined, the <b>Order of the Phoenix</b> is actually the book with the lowest number. This means that the vocabulary of the book is actually the least diverse of all the books. So the extra length is a result of words that are used in other places of the book.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the first two books, <b>Sorcerer's Stone</b> and <b>Chamber of Secrets</b> are the shortest, with respect to both text length and clean word count, these two books have the highest unique word count ratio. This means that the vocabulary usage is more diverse, with respect to length, than of the other books.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The total text length follows the word count of the clean text perfectly. This means that no one book was more effected by the clean-up process then another book was.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <p>One interesting analysis that can be performed on text is a <b>Lexical dispersion</b> analysis. This analysis will visually display where in the list of all words a specified term is used. Since our dataset includes seven books it would be interesting to see where in the series certain terms appear and if some information can be extracted from the visualization. The analysis will be done on the cleaned text, so that the similar terms of the same word, all group under a single version of the term.</p>

            <p>Eventhough the lexical dispersion plot is relatively simple, it still highlights some interesting things from the books: </p>
            <ul class="ul-check mb-5 list-unstyled success">
            <li> Harry is clearly the main protagonist and mentioned everywhere in the books, apart from a small section at the beginning of the sixth book. </li>
            <li> Ron and Hermione are the other main characteres and are introduced at a slighlty later point in the first book. </li>
            <li> The Dursley family is clearly mentioned infrequently, but consistently at the beginning of each book.</li>
            <li> Some characters are introduced at a later point in the series, such as Umbridge, Lupin, Sirius and Dobby.</li>
            <li> Fred and George seem to be mentioned in the same pattern, meaning that they appear to be mentioned at similar times. This makes sense, as they are twins and therefore often appear together.</li>
            <li> Some words are mentioned a lot more frequently later in the series, such as Voldemort. </li>
            <li> Similarly the word horcrux is introduced in the sixth book and continues to be frequently mentioned in the last book.</li>

            <h2 class="text-black" id="book-analysis-tf">Term frequency (TF) analysis</h2>
            <p>The next analysis that will be interesting to perform on the books dataset is a term frequency analysis. Here the idea is to extract which terms are most common in each book and in the books overall.</p>
            <div class="col-lg-12" data-aos="fade-left">
                <img src="images/books/books_tf.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid">

            <p><br>
            From the above figure it can be seen that the proportionally most frequent terms in all books are, <b>harry</b> followed by <br>said and then <b>ron</b> and <b>hermione</b>. In the clean word list for each book, close to 3 out of 100 words are <b>harry</b>. The ratio remains pretty consistent between the books, although it is highest in books 2 and 3, Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban.
            This is not surprising. However the graph above highlights some interesting aspects of the books. 
            It shows that <b>dumbledore</b> is most prominent in book 6, Half Blood Prince. It also shows how <b>hagrid</b> is much more prominent in the first book, than in the rest of the series. 
            <b>wand</b> becomes much more prominent in the last book, Deathly Hallows and similarly the <b>malfoy</b> family seems to be most prominent in book 2, Chamber of Secrets. Additionally the appearence of some prominent characters are clear, with <b>black</b> and <b>lupin</b> appearing in book 3, Prisoner of Azkaban. <b>sirius</b> becomes more prominent in the Order of the Pheonix, <b>lockhart</b> in the Chamber of Secrets and <b>slughorn</b> in the Half Blood Prince.

            It's interesting to see how much information relating to main secondary characters and themes of each books can be seen from such a relatively simple plot.

            Another interesting way to visualize and explore term frequencies are word clouds. To see what the overall words used in the Harry Potter book series are, a frequency distribution was generated using the whole cleaned text. Then a wordcloud was generated using the WordCloud plotting function.

            <p>From the above wordclouds it is clear that they contain very different information from the original wordcloud created using all the Harry Potter books. These wordclouds capture the differences between the books in the series and highlight the most important characters or topics:</p>
            <ul class="ul-check mb-5 list-unstyled success">

            <li><b>Sorcerer's Stone</b> Here the main terms relating to characters are most notably <b>Quirrel</b>, <b>Nicolas Flamel</b>, <b>Ronan</b> and <b>Pier</b>. Some words that seem to be more distinctive in this books are: <b>turban</b>, <b>chessman</b>, <b>mom</b> and <b>flute</b>. This all relates very well to what is known to be the storyline of the book. Where Professor <b>Quirrell</b> is a prominent character which wears a <b>turban</b>. The <b>flute</b> and <b>chessman</b> were important to the adventures of retrieving the sorcerer's stone created by <b>Nicolas Flamel</b></li>

            <li> <b>Chamber of Secrets</b> Here the main terms relating to characters are <b>Gilderoy Lockhart</b>, <b>Dobby</b>, <b>Myrtle</b> and <b>Riddle</b> which all were prominent in the second book. Some other things that played a big role in the book are <b>diary</b>, <b>basilisk</b> and <b>rooster</b></li>

            <li> <b>Prisoner Of Azkaban</b> Here some newly introduced characters are prominent, such as could be seen from the lexical dispersion plot and frequency term plots. <b>Lupin</b> is introduced but other characters such as <b>Marge</b>, <b>Pettigrew</b>, Ron's rat <b>Scabbers</b>, Hermione's cat <b>Crookshanks</b> and <b>Buckbeak</b> are prominent. Some other terms that occur frequently in the book are <b>boggart</b>, <b>dementors</b> and <b>firebolt</b> </li>

            <li> <b>Goblet of Fire</b> Here again some characters take the center stage. <b>Ludo Bagman</b> and <b>Winky</b> take center stage in this wordcloud, but are surrounded by other characters such as <b>Moody</b>, <b>Karkaroff</b>, <b>Krum</b>, <b>Cedric</b> and <b>Maxime</b>. Other things that are prominent are <b>beuxbatons</b>, <b>bulgarian</b> and <b>champion</b>. However the size of these objects are relatively small compared to the character name sizes. This is not surprising as this book introduces a lot of characters from other wizarding schools which do not appear in other books, so these would take center stage in the TF-IDF of the book.</li>

            <li> <b>Order of the Phoenix</b> Here characters are the most prominent in the wordcloud. <b>Umbridge</b> is the main villain in the book but other characters include <b>Kreacher</b>, <b>Sirius</b>, <b>Tonks</b>b>, <b>Lupin</b>, <b>Cho</b> and <b>Bellatrix</b>. Other terms such as <b>towards</b> and <b>backward</b> are for some reason very prominent. <b>Inquisitor</b> and <b>prophecy</b> are also among the most prominent non-character words, with <b>inquisitor</b> referring to the Inquisitorial Squad founded by <b>Umbridge</b></li>

            <li> <b>Half Blood Prince</b> Not surprisingly character names are still most prominent, <b>Slughorn</b>, <b>McLaggen</b>, <b>Morfin</b>, <b>Scrimgeour</b>, <b>Luna</b>, <b>Merope</b> and <b>Zabini</b>. Some other terms include <b>Felix Felicis</b> the luck potion, <b>prince</b>, relating to the half-blood prince, and <b>prohecy</b>. </li>

            <li> <b>Deathly Hallows</b> There some objects are prominent, such as <b>hallows</b>, referring to the <b>Deathly Hallows</b>. <b>Horcrux</b> is also a very frequently mention term in the book as can be seen. Additionally <b>diadem</b> and <b>locket</b> can also be seen, which both relate to being used as a horcrux. However again there are mostly character names that are more distinctive for this particular book in the series. Here <b>Xenophilius</b> and <b>Griphook</b> are the most prominent, along with <b>Ariana</b>, <b>Greyback</b>, <b>Cattermole</b> and <b>Kreacher</b>. </li>
            </ul>
            

            <h2 class="text-black" id="book-analysis-word-categories">Word category analysis</h2>
            <p>The words of a text can be categorised into different types or categories, such as nouns and adjectives. Each author has a different style and the writing style might even change over time. Therefore it might be interesting to see the distribution between the usage of different word categories for each book, and explore if these change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
            In order to do so the pos_tag function from the NLTK package can be used. It categorizes the words and marks them with a word category code:</p>

            <p>The analysis will be done on the previously cleaned text, just to simply the comparison a bit. The first analysis done will be a comparison between the word type usage of the different books. That way it should become clear if one book uses more of any one type of word category, or if the usage is uniform between all the books.
            </p>
            <div class="col-lg-12 text-center mb-4" data-aos="fade-left">

            </div>
            <p>From the above figure we can see that all of the books follow a similar pattern. The most common word category is a singular noun (NN) followed by adjectives (JJ) and verbs in past tense (VBD). Then there are adverbs (RB), verbs in present participle (VBG) followed by the rest of the word categories in smaller frequencies.</p>
            <p>Another thing that could perhaps shine a light on the differences between the books is how unique in usage each of the word types are for the books. By plotting the distinct count of word for each word category and dividing by the total number of words in the category, the ratios can be compared between the books.</p>
              <div class="col-lg-12 text-center mb-4" data-aos="fade-left">
                <img src="images/books/books_wordtypes2.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid">
            </div>          
            <p>From the above figure it can be seen that again the books follow a pretty similar pattern, but here there are more distinctions from the previous figure.</p>
            <p>
            <b>The Order of the Phoenix</b> clearly has the lowest ratio for verbs in present participle (VBG). This could be since this is the longest books, so it can be expected that each unique word is used relatively more frequently. Another interesting thing is that the <b> Half Blood Prince </b> Has by far the highest ratio of plural nouns (NNS). So it seems that the plural form is used more in that book compared to the others. However, it is important to note that the words have already been through a lemmitization process, where the inflected forms of a word are groupped together so that they can be analysed as a single item. Therefore these results might not correlate directly with the original word usage in the books.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            <h2 class="text-black" id="book-analysis-sentiment">Sentiment analysis</h2>
            <p>In this section a sentiment analysis will be performed the Harry Potter books. First the average sentiment over each book will explored and later on the average sentiment of each chapter will be explored. </p>
            <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" data-aos="fade-left">
                <img src="images/books/books_sentiment1.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <p>
            From the above graph it can be seen that the first book, Sorcerer's Stone, has the highest sentiment, 5.5, indicating that the language used there is slightly 'happier' than the other books. Then books 2 and 3, Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban, have much lower values than the first book, with similar values of around 5.455.Then there is a slight spike for book four, Goblet of Fire, followed with another drop in value for book 5, Order of the Phoenix. The differences here are of lower scale than the original first drop discussed. Then the sentiment value increases slightly for the sixth book, Half Blood Prince, but then for the final book it drops down to a value below 5.42. This means that the seventh and last book, Deathly Hallows, has around 0,08 lower sentimental value than the first book and is the book in the series with the leasty happy word usage. This is not really surprising as the books do get increasingly dark as the series progresses and the main characters face more difficult challenges.</p>

            <p>Finally to get a slightly clearer image of the development of sentiment over time the average sentiment was computed for each chapter. Then more datapoints could be seen along with the differences between the sentiment of different chapter, with the opportunity of being able to spot which chapter of the series seems to be the darkest one.</p>

            <p>The same procedure was used as before, only now for each chapter of the book.</p>
            
            <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" data-aos="fade-left">
                <img src="images/books/books_sentiment2.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            
            <p>
            In the graph below the sentiment of each chapter is plotted for each chapter in the book series. Therefore it is possible to see how the sentiment develops as the series progresses. It can be seen that the sentiment fluctuates between the chapters, sometimes dropping and picking backup in the next chapter. The sentiment for the first two books, Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, stays rougly betwen the values of 5,35 and 5,6. Books 3 and 4, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, have a greater range in sentiment value than the first two books. Book 5, Order of the Pheonix, seems to have much lower peaks of sentiment than the previous book. The range for book 6, Half Blood Prince, is very drastic and the third to last chapter has the lowest sentiment score of all the chapters in the series, almost close to 5,1. For the last book, the sentiment score fluctuates a lot between consecutive chapters, with a clear downwards slope. However there is not a single chapter there, that clearly has a much lower score, but rather there are six chapters with pretty low sentiment analysis scores.</p>

            <p>An interesting thing to do would be to investigate what is happening in the chapter whenever there is a dramatic drop:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Prisoner of Azkaban - chapter 17 - Cat, Rat and Dog</b><br>This chapter is a slight showdown between some of the characters in the book. Here accusations are flying over who killed whom and therefore that chapter contains words that have a lower sentimental score. This quote is a small sample of a dialog in the chapter which contains words with low sentimental value:
                    <div class="author-box col-lg-6" data-aos="fade-right">
                      <blockquote><b>Sirius Black: </b>&ldquo;Going to kill me, Harry?&rdquo;</blockquote>
                        <blockquote><b>Harry Potter: </b>&ldquo;You killed my parents.&rdquo;</blockquote>
                        <blockquote><b>Sirius Black: </b>&ldquo;I don't deny it... But if you knew the whole story.&rdquo;</blockquote>
                    </div><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Goblet of Fire - chapter 32 - Flesh, Blood and Bone</b><br>This chapter includes the murder of Cedric Diggory, which Harry witnesses. So it's not surprising that the sentiment value of the chapter is the lowest of those in this book.
                    <div class="author-box col-lg-6" data-aos="fade-left">
                      <blockquote><b>Voldemoret to Wormtail: </b>&ldquo;Kill the spare.&rdquo;</blockquote>

                    </div><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Order of the Phoenix - chapter 35 - Beyond the Veil</b><br>This chapter has the lowest sentiment value of the chapters up to this point in the series. In this chapter the group is fighting a great battle and are nearly defeated. In the battle Sirius Black is blasted with a spell and dies.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Half Blood Prince - chapter 28 - Flight of the Prince</b><br>This chapter has the lowest sentiment value of all the chapters in the series. This his however not surprising as in this chapter immediatly following the death of Albus Dumbledore, one of the series most beloved characters. He was killed by Severus Snape, which enraged Harry to pursue Snape through battle in the halls of the school and out onto the grounds, where he attempts to curse Snape.<br>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <p>Lastly it can be interesting to compute the moving average of the sentiment using a 5 chapter window. That way the path should become slightly smoother and the trends become more visible. </p>
            <div class="col-lg-12 text-center" data-aos="fade-left">

            </div>
            <p>The figure above highlights clearly that there is a downwards trend in sentiment at the end of each book. Generally the books begin with a higher sentiment, fluctuate a little over the chapters and then drop towards the end. The last book clearly has the most general downwards trend of all the books, and also has the lowest average sentiment score.</p>
