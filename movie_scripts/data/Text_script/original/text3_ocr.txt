WIDE HELICOPTER SHOT. Privet Drive. CAMERA CRANES DOWN,

NUMBER 4. HARRY POTTER sits in the window.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM —- DAY

Harry pages through a SCRAPBOOK, stops on a MOVING PHOTO
of Ron and Hermione. SQUAWK! Harry jumps. HEDWIG pecks
at the LOCK slung through her cage door, then glowers at
Harry.

HARRY
I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed
to use magic outside of school.
Besides, if Uncle Vernon -
At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.

UNCLE VERNON (0O.S.)
Har-ry Pot-ter!

HARRY
Now you've done it.

INT. KITCHEN —- DAY

While AUNT PETUNIA puts the finishing touches to a
PUDDING of WHIPPED CREAM and SUGARED VIOLETS, UNCLE
VERNON struggles with DUDLEY'S BOW TIE, all the while
glowering at Harry.

UNCLE VERNON
I warned you. If you can't
control that bloody bird, it'll
have to go.

HARRY
She's bored. If I could just let
her out for an hour or two -
UNCLE VERNON
And have you sending secret
messages to your freaky little
friends? No, sir.

HARRY
But I haven't gotten any messages.
From any of my friends. Not one.
All summer.

DUDLEY
Who'd want to be friends with you?

UNCLE VERNON
I should think you'd be more
grateful. We raise you since you
were a baby, give you food off our
table, even let you have Dudley's
second bedroom... purely out of
the goodness of our hearts.

DUDLEY
I thought he got the second
bedroom because Mum was afraid
he'd turn us into dung beetles if
you put him back in the cupboard
under the stairs.

AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle
Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for the
pudding.

AUNT PETUNIA
Not yet, popkin. That's for when
the Masons arrive.

UNCLE VERNON
Which should be any moment. Now.
Let's run through our schedule one
more time. Petunia, when the
Masons get here, you will be -
AUNT PETUNIA
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

UNCLE VERNON
Good. And Dudley?

DUDLEY
I'll be waiting to open the door.

UNCLE VERNON
Excellent.
(turning on Harry)
And you?

HARRY
I'll be in my bedroom, making no
noise and pretending I don't
exist.

UNCLE VERNON
Too right you will. With any
luck, this could well be the day I
make the biggest deal of my
career.

DOORBELL RINGS. Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry out
of the kitchen and into the hallway.

UNCLE VERNON
Upstairs! Hurry!

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM —- DAY

Harry enters, turns, and stops dead: a tiny CREATURE
with bat-like ears and bulging green eyes is jumping on
his bed as if it were a trampoline. This is DOBBY.

DOBBY
Harry Potter! Such an honor it
is!

(CONTINUED )

HARRY
What... Who are you?

DOBBY
Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf.

HARRY
I see. Not to be rude or
anything, but this isn't a great
time for me to have a house-elf in
my bedroom.

DOBBY
Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands.
It's just that, Dobby has come to
tell you... it is difficult, sir...
Dobby wonders where to begin.

HARRY
Why don't you sit down?

DOBBY
S-s-sit down?

Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS. LOUD TEARS. Harry
panics.

HARRY
Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything -
DOBBY
Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of
your greatness, sir, but never has
he been asked to sit down by a
wizard, like an equal...

HARRY
You can't have met many decent
wizards then.

Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off the
bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.

DOBBY
Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
INT. LIVING ROOM —- DAY 7
Uncle Vernon pours champagne for MR. and MRS. MASON. As
Dobby's HEAD BANGING sounds from above, all eyes shift to

the ceiling. Uncle Vernon chuckles nervously.

UNCLE VERNON
Don't mind that. It's just the...
cat.

DUDLEY
Cat? What cat?

UNCLE VERNON
Our cat, tiger.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM —- DAY

Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning
dizzily. Harry regards him with a mixture of concern...
and wariness.

HARRY
Are you... all right?

DOBBY
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby almost spoke ill of his
family, sir.

HARRY
Your... family?

DOBBY
The wizard family Dobby serves,
Sir. Dobby is bound to serve one
family forever. If they ever knew
Dobby was here...

Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.

DOBBY
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn
him.

(in a fierce whisper)

Harry Potter must not go back to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry this year.

HARRY
Not go back? But... I have to.

DOBBY
This is a plot. A plot to make
most terrible things happen. If
Harry Potter goes back to school
he will be in great danger.

(CONTINUED )

HARRY
What terrible things? Who's
plotting them?

Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and GAGGING noise.

HARRY
Okay! I understand. You can't
say -
Too late. Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts
beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY.

INT. LIVING ROOM —- DAY 9
Uncle Vernon is in the midst of telling a joke.

UNCLE VERNON
They arrive at the ninth hole
and!-
DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing out from above.

MR. MASON
Sounds as if that cat of yours has
dragged something in with it,
Dursley.

UNCLE VERNON
Not to worry. I'll sort it out.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 10
Harry wrestles the lamp away from Dobby.

HARRY
Stop! Stop!

FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grabs
Dobby by the pillowcase and pitches him into the
wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.

UNCLE VERNON
What the devil are you doing up
here! You've just ruined the
punch line of my Japanese golfer
joke. One more sound and you'll
wish you'd never been born, boy!

He stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR.
Harry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe.

HARRY
See why I've got to go back? I
don't belong here. I belong in

your world -- at Hogwarts. It's
the only place I've got...
friends.

DOBBY

Friends who don't even write to
Harry Potter?

HARRY
Well, I expect they've been -hang on, how do you know my
friends haven't been writing me?

Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.

DOBBY
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with
Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry
Potter thought his friends had
forgotten him... Harry Potter
might not want to go back to
school, Sir...

HARRY
Give me those. Now.

Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door.
Panicking...

INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS/KITCHEN —- DAY 11

... Harry flies desperately after, Dobby bouncing like a
ping-pong ball down the stairs and into the kitchen. As
Harry races in, he finds Dobby on the counter, waving his
arms. Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding RISES,
then floats into the living room, HOVERING over the
Mason's heads. The Masons don't see, but the Dursleys -goggle-eyed--do.

HARRY
Dobby... Please... No...

DOBBY
Harry Potter must say he's not
going back to school.

HARRY
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

Dobby SNAPS HIS FINGERS. The pudding PLUMMETS...
Straight onto the Masons. They stand blinking, covered
head to foot with whipped cream and sugared violets. The
Masons exit. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia race after
them.

UNCLE VERNON
I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very
disturbed. Meeting strangers
upsets him, so we kept him
upstairs...

EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - DAY 11A
The Masons RACE out of the house, the Dursleys FOLLOWING.

AUNT PETUNIA
We have ice cream...

The Masons get into their car and drive off, just as a
SHRIEKING SOUND splits the sky. An OWL SWOOPS down, and
DROPS a LETTER at Uncle Vernon's feet. He picks up the
letter, opens it. As he reads it, a mad gleam dances in
Uncle Vernon's eye. He turns and races back inside the
house. Aunt Petunia follows.

INT. DURSLEY HOUSE —- NIGHT 11B

Uncle Vernon runs back into the living room, extends the
letter to Harry.

UNCLE VERNON
Go on. Read it.

HARRY
‘Dear Mr. Potter. We have
received intelligence that a Hover

EXT./INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY 12

A SHORT MONTAGE BEGINS:

Uncle Vernon fits IRON BARS to the inside of Harry's
window.

Drills a METAL FLAP to the base of the bedroom door.

Fits a FAT, GREY LOCK to the door itself. Soaking with
Sweat, he casts Harry a nasty grin and pulls shut the
DOOR. It closes with the DULL CLANK of a cell.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

Harry stares gloomily out the window. The METAL FLAP
RATTLES and Dudley's pudgy hand slides a BOWL of TINNED
SOUP onto the floor. He grins cruelly through the
opening.

DUDLEY
I know what day it is.

HARRY
Well done, Dudley. Finally
learned the days of the week, have

you.

DUDLEY
Today's your birthday. And nobody
cares.

Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap. Harry sighs, takes the soup
and a bit of stale bread, and crosses to Hedwig.

HARRY
It's no good turning your beak up.
It's all we've got.
Harry feeds a piece of bread to Hedwig... as we...

see... RON WEASLEY staring through the bedroom window.
HARRY
Ron?
RON

Hiya, Harry.

EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE —- NIGHT 13A

An OLD, TURQUOISE-COLORED FORD ANGLIA floats in midair.
Ron leans out the back window. His brother FRED sits in
the driver's seat. Fred's twin George is in the
passenger seat.

HARRY
Fred? George? What're you doing
here?

RON

Rescuing you, of course. Where's

your trunk?
CLOSEUP - HARRY'S TRUNK 13B
Stuffed with clothes, spellbooks. The trunk CLOSES, SNAPS

tie off a fierce knot on the bars of Harry's window.

Stand back.

Harry steps back. Ron turns, nods to Fred.

Fred STEPS ON the accelerator.

EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 13D
The Ford Anglia FLIES UP into the air, the rope SNAPS

SQUAWK !

HARRY
Hedwig!

Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto
the ledge, when... BAM! The bedroom door CRASHES OPEN.

UNCLE VERNON
Petunia! He's getting away!

As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES
FORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle. Harry tumbles into the
darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other
reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possible
second.

Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls
harder. Ron braces himself, pulls back. Harry hangs,
stretched high over the lawn, directly above the mangled
steel bars.

CLOSEUP: Harry's hand begins to slip from Ron's fingers.
INSIDE OF CAGE: Hedwig PECKS feverishly at the LOCK.
CLOSE-UP: Ron. PANICKED.

RON
Hold on, Harry!

UNCLE VERNON
Oh no, boy! You and that bloody
pigeon aren't going anywhere!

CLOSE-UP: Harry's hand begins to slip away from Ron's.

INSIDE OF CAGE: Hedwig PECKS HARDER and... the CAGE

Hedwig SWOOPS into the sky, WHEELS BACK and hammers her
beak into Uncle Vernon's hand. He ROARS, stumbles back

By the way, Harry. Happy
Birthday.

EXT. THE BURROW - EARLY MORNING 18

As the Anglia drops through a pink sky, a haphazard mess
of a HOUSE, built around a towering central chimney,
appears below. By the road, a lopsided SIGN reads: THE
BURROW. FLUMPH! The car touches down in a WHIRLING CONE
of dust, scatters a group of chickens, and fishtails toa
halt. The boys spill quickly out of the car. FRED
WHISPERS urgently.

FRED
Hurry! Let's nip inside before
Mum wakes up!

INT. FRONT ROOM - THE BURROW - MOMENTS LATER 19

The boys sneak inside, gently close the door. Harry
stops. Magical objects surround him: A CLOCK displays
different chores for each family member. A pair of
NEEDLES knit a sweater by themselves. And a stack of
PLAYING CARDS that. A stack of PLAYING CARDS SHUFFLE
themselves, providing a cooling breeze for Ron's aging
rat, SCABBERS. Ron shrugs, averts his eyes selfconsciously.

RON
It's not much.
HARRY
I think it's... brilliant!

Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face. Slowly...
GRINS.

The front door OPENS and ARTHUR WEASLEY enters. A tall
man with red hair, his robes look dusty and travel-worn.

MR. WEASLEY
What a night! Nine raids! Nine!

Raids?

MR. WEASLEY
Good Lord, are you really? Ron's
told us all about you, of course.
When did you get here?

MR. WEASLEY

Did you now! How'd it go?!

wife's eye)
I... I mean... That was very
wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed.
So, Harry. You must know all
about Muggles. Tell me, what
exactly is the function of a
parking meter?

Harry is about to answer, when he notices an OWL (ERROL)
soaring toward the kitchen window. To Harry's horror,
the owl doesn't pull up. It just flies... SMACK!... into
the glass.

MRS. WEASLEY
That must be Errol with the post.
Fetch him, will you, George?

George takes the unconscious Errol, absently lays him on
a draining board, and takes the LETTERS clutched in his
claws.

his shattered glasses. He's tumbled into a wizard's
shop, but a decidedly creepy one. He starts to exit,
when a WITHERED HAND in a GLASS CASE catches his eye:

The Hand of Glory. Nearby, an OPAL NECKLACE gleams:
Caution: Do not touch. Cursed--Has Claimed the Lives of
Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. Oddly transfixed by it
all, Harry drifts toward the exit, when...

about, spies a LARGE BLACK CABINET and slips inside. As
he pulls the doors closed, a TINY CARD swings INTO VIEW:
Crushing Cabinet.

Malfoy and his father enter. A stooped man (MR. BORGIN)
emerges from the back room. IN THE CABINET, Harry
watches, unaware that the walls around him are... SLOWLY
CLOSING IN.

MR. BORGIN
Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to
see you again. If I may, just in
today -
LUCIUS MALFOY
I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin.
But selling.

MR. BORGIN
Selling?

LUCIUS MALFOY
You have heard, of course, that
the Ministry of Magic is
conducting more raids. There are
even rumors of a new Muggle
Protection Act...

Lucius unravels a roll of parchment, hands it to Borgin.

LUCIUS MALFOY
I have a few... ah... items at
home that might prove embarrassing
if the Ministry were to call.
Certain poisons and the like...

MR. BORGIN
Hmmm... yes. I see...

INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING
IN. His eyes shift upward. The ceiling is DROPPING.

Draco drifts to the Hand of Glory, reaches out, when...
the HAND GRABS HIM. Draco shrieks, manages to slip free,
then calms. He eyes the hand with malicious glee.

Hopefully my son will amount to
more than a thief, Mr. Borgin.
Though if his marks don't pick

up -
DRACO
It's not my fault the teachers
have favorites. That Hermione
Granger -
LUCIUS MALFOY
I would have thought you'd be
ashamed that a girl of no
Wizarding family beat you in every

blood is counting for less

Borgin checks off one last time, then returns the
parchment to Lucius. Satisfied, Malfoy nods.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Very good. I'll expect you at the
manor tomorrow. Come, Draco.

They exit. As Borgin slips into the back room, the
Crushing Cabinet's doors FLY OPEN and Harry leaps free.
Inside, the walls, floor, and ceiling SNAP SHUT! Borgin
reappears, blinks curiously at Harry, then watches him
RACE out the door.

actually a MOVING PHOTOGRAPH propped in the window. A
PLACARD declares: HERE TODAY! SIGNING COPIES OF HIS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, MAGICAL ME... GILDEROY LOCKHART!

INT. FLOURISH AND BLOTTS —- DAY 30

Harry and the others thread their way through a
CHATTERING THRONG of MIDDLE-AGED LADIES, all craning
their necks for a view of Lockhart, who sits Signing
books at the rear of the shop. At the sight of him, Mrs.
Weasley pats her hair.

MRS. WEASLEY
There he is!

RON
Mum fancies him.

For this, Mrs. Weasley gives Ron a jab in the shoulder.
A SHORT MAN WITH A CAMERA bumps past.

SHORT MAN
Out of the way! This is for The

Daily Prophet!

Instantly, Lockhart looks up, flashes a smile, when...

GILDEROY LOCKHART
It can't be Harry Potter?

The crowd WHISPERS excitedly as Lockhart dives forward,
seizes Harry's hand and turns him toward the
photographer.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

(under his breath)
Nice big smile, Harry. Together,
you and I rate the front page.

(as the CAMERA FLASHES )
Ladies and gentlemen! What an
extraordinary moment this is!
When young Harry here stepped into
Flourish and Blotts this morning
to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me -- which, incidentally
is celebrating its twenty-seventh
week atop The Daily Prophet's
Bestseller List -- he had no idea
that he would, in fact, be leaving
with my entire collected works!
Free of charge!

As the crowd CLAPS, Lockhart catches the eye of a FLUNKY
and, before Harry knows it, a towering stack of books is
shoved into his arms. Mortified, Harry mumbles quietly.

HARRY
Thank you.

Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red
with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's
cauldron.

HARRY
You have these. I'll buy my
own! -
DRACO

(appearing, sneers)
Bet you loved that, didn't you,
Potter? Famous Harry Potter.
Can't even go into a bookshop

LUCIUS MALFOY
Silence, Draco! Ah... Mr. Potter.
I don't believe we've met.

Lucius Malfoy extends his hand, as if offering to shake
Harry's, but instead gently plays his fingers over the
fringe of Harry's scalp, revealing Harry's LIGHTNING BOLT
SCAR. At his touch, Harry withdraws, ever so slightly.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your
scar is legend. As, of course, is
the wizard who gave it to you.

HARRY
He was a murderer.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Yes, a pity about your parents.
Curious that you yourself should
escape with a mere flesh wound.
Curious, too, that you speak of
him in the past. Surely, you
don't think He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed is gone forever.

HARRY
His name is Voldemort.

Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.

LUCIUS MALFOY
You must be very brave, Mr.
Potter, to dare speak his name.
Or foolish.

HERMIONE
Fear of a name only increases fear
of the thing itself.

Lucius Malfoy's eyes slide, find Hermione staring
defiantly.

LUCIUS MALFOY
You must be Miss Granger. Draco's
told me all about you... and your
parents. Muggles, aren't you?

Mr. and Mrs. Granger nod nervously. Lucius Malfoy can
barely disguise his distaste for them. Arthur Weasley
hurries over.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Busy time at the Ministry. All
those raids. I hope they're
paying you overtime.

Malfoy reaches into Ginny's cauldron, removes a very old,
battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Obviously not. Dear me. What's
the use of being a disgrace to the
name of wizard if they don't even
pay you well for it.

MR. WEASLEY
We have a very different idea
about what disgraces the name of
wizard, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY
(glancing at the
Grangers )
Clearly. The company you keep,
Weasley. And I thought your
family could sink no lower.

Mr. Weasley moves to hit Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid steps
forward, puts a firm hand on Mr. Weasley's shoulder.

HAGRID
Ignore ‘im, Arthur.

Mr. Weasley backs away. Lucius Malfoy tosses Ginny's
BATTERED TEXTBOOK back into her cauldron.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Here, girl. Take your book. It's
the best your father can give you.

Lucius and Draco exit. Hagrid looks at the Weasleys.

Sorry. Lost control of the

The train leaves at exactly eleven

Ron TAPS his WAND on the dash and the Anglia burbles to

HARRY
No offense, Ron, but are you sure
you know how to fly this.

RON
No problem.

Ron SHIFTS. With a GREAT JOLT, the car lifts from the
ground.
RON
There. See. Now I reckon all we
have to do is find the Hogwarts
Express and follow it. Simple.

Harry nods, not entirely convinced. He peers out the
window. Down below, TWO PEDESTRIANS stare in disbelief.

HARRY
Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most
Muggles aren't accustomed to
seeing a flying car.

Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and
they... DISAPPEAR. Down below, the baffled pedestrians

CAMERA STARTS IN the clouds, passes through, finds
Scotland's stunning green. The Anglia's ENGINE PUTTERS
softly, when -- POP! - the car reappears. Ron jabs at
the silver button.

RON
Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff. The
car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.

RON
Any sign of the train?

HARRY
There! Up ahead! Look...

Along a STEEP BRIDGE, a single line of TRAIN TRACKS
appear.

RON
Brilliant.

Ron SHIFTS, GLIDES DOWN, until the Anglia is only a few
feet above the tracks. The boys peer ahead, looking for
the train.

RON
It must be around here
someplace.

Behind them, through the Anglia's rear window, the
Hogwarts Express APPEARS, closing fast. Harry and Ron
perk up. Smile.

HARRY
Do you hear that?

Then, at precisely the same moment, Harry and Ron
register the DIRECTION of the sound. They glance at each
other, turn as one and see the train GROWING HUGE in the
rear window.

HARRY /RON
Aaaahhhhh!
Ron SPINS THE WHEEL, puts his foot to the gas and -- at

train's path. The car WAFFLES, TOPPLES upside down

watches the Hogwarts Express ZIP PAST and, in one window,
glimpses NEVILLE and SEAMUS, mouths open in astonishment.

RON
Take my hand!

Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far
below. It's quite a drop. Harry's fingers begin to LOSE
THEIR GRIP.

RON
Hold on!

HARRY
I'm trying! Your hand's all

Straining, Ron yanks him inside, levels off the car. As
Harry falls heavily into his seat, he BUCKLES his safety
belt.

HARRY
I think we found the train.

Harry smiles at the sight of it, when... the Anglia

HARRY

Just out of interest, Ron. Have
you ever landed a car before?

clears the castle wall. Harry and Ron exchange a look of
relief, when... the car GROANS again, LURCHES...
downward.

HARRY
MIND THAT TREE!

Down below a GIANT WILLOW TREE looms. Ron SHIFTS.
Nothing.

HARRY
TURN! TURN!

Harry reaches over and, together, he and Ron SPIN THE
WHEEL. It's useless. The car is heading straight for the
tree. Desperately, Ron WHIPS OUT his wand and WHACKS THE
DASHBOARD.

RON
STOP! STOP! STOP!

The wand SNAPS IN TWO and -- CRUNCH! -- car meets tree.
Harry blinks. They hang dreamily, BALANCED on the
HIGHEST LIMB.

RON

HARRY
Be thankful it's not your neck.

THWUNMP! Something HEAVY HITS Harry's door, sends a
SHUDDER through the car.

through the air and... LANDS on lower grid of branches.
RON

What kind of tree is this?

Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE
CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like
popcorn. WINDOWS SHATTER. Heavy DENTS appear on the
roof above Ron and Harry's heads. Then the car FALLS
again...

--- SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND. Instantly, the
tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear
windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR
BACK AND FORTH.

HARRY /RON
Aaaaahhhhh!

The tree PITCHES the car into the air. As the Anglia
SLAMS DOWN again, bobbing on its SQUEALING SHOCKS, the
ENGINE BURBLES BACK TO LIFE. Harry LOOKS UP, peering
through the shattered windscreen. The willow's branches,
as one, rear back, ready for one last punishing blow.
Harry CRIES OUT.

HARRY
Reverse! Reverse!

Ron SHIFTS, the CAR SHOOTS BACKWARDS, and the willow
PUMMELS THE TREAD-MARKED GROUND they just vacated.

Safely clear, the doors fly open, the seats tip sideways,
and Ron and Harry are ejected. As they hit the ground,
their trunks fly from the boot, Hedwig's cage rockets out
the back window, and Hedwig herself flaps into the night.
Taillights blazing angrily, the BATTERED car speeds off,
fishtailing into the Dark Forest.

RON
Dad's going to kill me.

They hear a TREMENDOUS GROAN, turn back, and see the
Whomping Willow assume its natural form, waiting for its
next victim.

Splendid. Now, I suggest we
return to the feast. There's a
delicious-looking custard tart I

Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor. Taking it,
he reads the back: "KWIKSPELL. A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN

here can tell me the properties of
the Mandrake? Yes, Miss Granger.

HERMIONE
Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used
to return those who have been
transfigured to their original
state. It's also quite dangerous.
The Mandrake's cry is fatal to
anyone who hears it.

PROFESSOR SPROUT
Excellent. Ten points to
Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are
only seedlings, their cries won't
kill yet. However, they will
knock you out for several hours.
That is why I have provided each
of you with a pair of earmuffs.
If you would then...

Ron frowns. He's gotten a BRIGHT PINK FLUFFY pair. When
the class is ready, Professor Sprout leads them to the
GARDEN AREA. She grasps one of the TUFTY PLANTS before
her... and pulls. Harry gasps. Instead of roots, a
small, muddy, extremely ugly BABY pops out of the earth,
leaves growing right out of its head. Neville's eyes
ROLL BACK. He FAINTS.

the LARGE, COVERED CAGE RATTLING mysteriously on his desk.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts
Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart,
Order of Merlin, Third Class,
Honorary Member of the Dark Force
Defense League and five times
winner of Witch Weekly's MostCharming-Smile Award -- But I
don't talk about that. I didn't
get rid of the Bandon Banshee by
smiling at her!

Lockhart awaits laughter. A few students smile weakly.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
I see you've all bought a complete
set of my books. Well done. I
thought we'd start today with a
little quiz. Nothing to worry
about. Just to check how well
you've read them, how much you've
taken in...

Lockhart begins to circulate papers. Harry and Ron

examine the questions. Ron WHISPERS to Harry.

Look at these guestions. They're
all about him.

‘What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?’

RON
‘What 1s Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?'

rid the world of evil and market
my own range of hair care potions.
Good girl.

Hermione beams. lLockhart's expression suddenly darkens.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Now... be warned! It is my job to
arm you against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind!
You may find yourself facing your
own worst fears in this room.
Know only that no harm can befall
you whilst I am here...

With a showman's flair, Lockhart turns slowly to the cage.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
I must ask you not to scream. It
might provoke them.

A pale Neville draws back. Harry and Ron lean forward.
Lockhart lets the tension build, then WHIPS off the
cover. Inside the cage are several electric blue
CREATURES. Eight inches tall, with pointed faces and
wings, they rattle the bars and pull bizarre faces at the
students.

SEAMUS
Cornish pixies?

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

Unable to control himself, Seamus SNORTS with laughter.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan,

tricky little blighters. Let's
see what you make of them now!

Lockhart flings open the cage. Instantly, the pixies
rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles,

The Gryffindor Quidditch team -- Harry, Fred, George,
ALICIA SPINNET, KATIE BELL, and ANGELINA JOHNSON -- trail

Oliver Wood through the courtyard, toward the distant
Quidditch pitch. Several students are outside, studying.

WOOD
I spent the summer devising a
whole new Quidditch program.
We're going to train earlier,
harder, and longer!
(squinting)
What the... I don't believe it!

Crossing the courtyard from the other side are SEVEN BOYS
in GREEN ROBES, also carrying broomsticks. At their lead
is MARCUS FLINT, trollish Slytherin Captain. Ron,
Sitting at a table with Hermione, looks up.

Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

Clear out, Flint! I booked the

FLINT
Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

As Wood snatches the PARCHMENT from Flint's hand, Ron and
Hermione come up to join the others.

WOOD

'I, Professor Severus Snape, do
hereby give the Slytherin team
permission to practice today,
Owing to the need to train their
new Seeker.'

(looking up)
You've got a new Seeker? Who?

A pasty-faced boy pushes to the front. It's... Malfoy.
HARRY
Draco?
DRACO

That's right. And that's not all
that's new this year...

As one, the seven Slytherins hold out seven brand-new
GLEAMING BROOMSTICKS. The Gryffindors look stunned.

RON
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand
Ones.

FLINT
A generous gift from Draco's
father.

DRACO

That's right, Weasley. You see,

Fred and George fly for Draco's throat. Oliver Wood
holds them back.

WOOD
Save it for the match.

RON
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!
(whips out his wand)
Eat slugs!

Ron points his cracked wand at Malfoy. PFFT! -- a BOLT
of GREEN LIGHT scissors out the wrong end, hitting Ron
himself in the stomach. As he drops to the grass,
Hermione runs to him

HERMIONE
Ron! Say something!

Ron opens his mouth and... BELCHES. Hermione draws back,
and watches a TRIO of SLUGS dribble out his mouth. The
Slytherins CROW with LAUGHTER. Angrily, Ron rises, only
to BELCH again. Fascinated, Colin Creevey runs up with
his camera.

COLIN
Wow! Can you hold him still,

HARRY

Get out of the way, Colin!

HERMIONE
(quietly)
He called me a Mudblood.

HAGRID
He didn'!

Harry looks confused. Hermione glances at him, then
away, Obviously pained by this.

HERMIONE
It means dirty blood. Mudblood's
a really foul name for someone who
was Muggle-born. Someone with
non-magic parents. Someone...
like me. It's not a term one
usually hears in civilized
conversation.

HAGRID
Yeh see, Harry. There are some
wizards -- like Malfoy's family -who think they're better than
everyone else ‘cause they're what
people call pureblood.

HARRY
That's horrible.

RON
(BELCHES forth a
slug)
It's disgusting!

HAGRID

An' it's codswallop ter boot.
Dirty blood. There's ‘ardly a
wizard today that's not half-blood

Muggles we'd've died out long ago.

What's that? Hanging underneath?

HARRY
That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris.

The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket,
eyes open and blank. Harry's eyes shift to the adjacent

Silvery thread, fight to get through a crack in the

As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wall

It was definitely a curse that
killed her -- probably the
Transmogrifian Torture.

Filch is trying to learn magic

She taps the bird in front of her, three times, with the tip
of her wand. It transfigures into a beautiful crystal water
goblet.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (CONT'D)
Godric Gryffindor, Helga
Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and
Salazar Slytherin. Three of the
founders co-existed quite
harmoniously. One did not.

RON
Three glasses who?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective about the students
admitted to Hogwarts. He believed
that magical learning should be
kept within all-magic families.
In other words, purebloods.
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.

(a beat)

According to legend, Slytherin had
built a hidden chamber in this
castle, known as the Chamber of
Secrets. Shortly before
departing, he sealed it until that
time when his own true heir
returned to the school. The heir
alone would be able to open the
Chamber of Secrets and unleash the
horror within, and by so doing,
purge the school of all those who,
in Slytherin's view, were unworthy
to study magic.

HERMIONE
Muggle-borns.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Yes. Naturally, the school has been
searched many times for such a
Chamber. It has never been found.

HERMIONE
Professor, what exactly does
legend tell us lies within the
Chamber?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
The Chamber is said to be home to
something which the heir of Slytherin
alone can control. It is said to be
home... to a monster.

Harry circles high above the pitch, searching for the

above Malfoy's left ear is... the GOLDEN SNITCH. Harry
CHARGES. Malfoy GULPS, swings clear, and watches Harry
rocket past.

As Harry chases the plummeting Snitch, Malfoy FOLLOWS IN
HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing the HISSING
SNITCH deep into the TRENCH circling the pitch. Shoulder
to shoulder, they RACE MADLY, driving and dodging the
wooden support beams that crisscross their path.

Directly behind them, the Bludger FOLLOWS, SHATTERING the
BEAMS as it dogs Harry.

Malfoy KICKS Harry, forcing him to the edge of the
trench. Harry BRUSHES the wall, battling for control.
Malfoy turns, SNICKERS, then looks back... and finds
himself heading smack into a wooden beam. Panicked, he
tries to pull up. Too late. Broom meets beam and Malfoy

Harry cries out, steadies himself and with a brilliant,
acrobatic move, SNATCHES the Snitch out of the air with
his good hand. Unable to control his broom with his

shattered arm, he hits the pitch with a SICKENING THUD.

Wincing, Harry rolls onto his shoulders, SQUINTS UP: a
BLACK DOT -- growing rapidly LARGER -- is plummeting from
the sky, directly toward him. It's... the rogue Bludger.
Instantly, Harry spins away, grimacing in agony, as the

TATTOOING the pitch again and again, only inches from
Harry. Calmly, Hermione strides forth, points her wand.

Spinning. Drops heavily to the pitch. Harry exhales,

Harry Potter triumphed over He Who
Must Not Be Named. We house elves
were treated like vermin, sir. Of
course, Dobby is still treated
like vermin...

Dobby HONKS his nose on the filthy pillowcase he wears.

HARRY
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

DOBBY
This, sir? ‘Tis a mark of the
house elf's enslavement. Dobby
can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes. The
family is careful not to pass
Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for
then he would be free to leave
their house forever.

Dobby's ears QUIVER, detecting... FOOTSTEPS. He
WHISPERS.

DOBBY
Terrible things are about to
happen at Hogwarts! Harry Potter
must not stay here now that
history is to repeat itself!

HARRY
Repeat itself? You mean, this has
happened before?

Dobby seizes the Skele-Gro, BEATS himself about the head.

HARRY
Tell me, Dobby? When did this
happen before? Who's doing it
now?

DOBBY
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only
wants Harry Potter to be safe.

HARRY
No, Dobby! Tell me! Who is it?

CRACK! Dobby is gone. SHADOWS flicker beyond the
CURTAIN encircling Harry's bed. Harry slumps down...
peers through a slit in the curtains. Dumbledore, ina
nightcap, and McGonagall, in a tartan robe, heave a SMALL
STATUE onto an empty bed. Seconds later, Madam Pomfrey
bustles in.

MADAM POMFREY
What's happened?

DUMBLEDORE
There's been another attack.

Madam Pomfrey GASPS. It is not a statue lying there. It
is Colin Creevey, CAMERA still clutched to his eye.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Perhaps he managed to get a
picture of his attacker...

Dumbledore opens the camera. A JET OF STEAM HISSES
forth.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
What does this mean, Albus?

DUMBLEDORE
It means our students are in great
danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was
fortunate. If not for this...
(holding up the camera)
He would surely be dead.

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM —- DAY 69

A gloomy place. Cracked mirrors. Chipped sinks.
Guttering candles. Harry and Ron huddle over a SMALL,
BUBBLING CAULDRON, as Hermione adds STRANGE INGREDIENTS.

HERMIONE
Again? You mean, the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened before?

RON
Of course! Don't you see? Lucius
Malfoy must've opened it when he
was at school here, and now he's
told Draco how to do it.

HERMIONE
Maybe. We'll have to wait for the
Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

RON
Enlighten me. Why are we
brewing this potion in broad
daylight, in the middle of a
girls' lavatory? Don't you think
we'll get caught?

HERMIONE
Never. No one over comes in here.

RON
Why?

HERMIONE
Moaning Myrtle.

RON
Who's Moaning Myrtle?

There isa LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A
YOUNG GIRL COMES RACING OUT OF THE WALL. FACE TO FACE
with Ron.

MOANING MYRTLE
I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't
expect you to know me. Who
would ever talk about fat, ugly,
miserable, moping, moaning
Myrtle?

Myrtle SOBS LOUDLY, DIVES head first into the toilet.

HERMIONE
She's a little sensitive.

INT. GREAT HALL —- DAY 70

NOTICE-BOARD: DUELING CLUB! First Meeting Tonight. A
GOLDEN STAGE has been erected. Lockhart struts atop it.
Harry, Ron, Hermione and good number of other students
watch.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Gather round! Gather round! Can
everyone see me? Can you all hear
me? Excellent. In light of the
dark events of recent weeks,
Professor Dumbledore has granted
me permission to start this little
Dueling Club, to train you all up
in case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done
on countless occasions -- for full
details, see my published works.

The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns to
him.

JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY
That Lockhart's something, isn't
he? Awfully brave chap.
(offering his hand)
Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Hufflepuff.

HARRY
Nice to meet you. I'm -
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY
I know who you are. We all do.
Even us Muggle-borns.

Justin grins agreeably, looks back to the stage, where
Professor Snape has joined Lockhart.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Let me introduce my assistant
Professor Snape. He has
Ssportingly agreed to help me with
a short demonstration. Now I
don't want any of you youngsters
to worry. You'll still have your
Potions Master when I'm through
with him, never fear!

RON
What's the fun in that?

Lockhart and Snape face each other and bow. They turn,
walk ten paces, then... SPIN... wands poised like swords.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
As you can see, we are holding our
wands in the accepted combative
position. On the count of three,
we will cast our first spells.
Neither of us will be aiming to
kill, of course.

HARRY
(eyeing Snape)
I wouldn't bet on that.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
One-two-three -
SNAPE
Expelliarmus!

A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS
Lockhart off his feet and into the wall behind.

HERMIONE
Do you think he's all right?

HARRY /RON
Who cares?

GILDEROY LOCKHART
(rising unsteadily)
Well, there you have it. That was
a Disarming Charm. As you see,
I've lost my wand.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

(as Hermione returns it)
Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes,
an excellent idea to show them
that, Professor Snape, but if you
don't mind my saying so, it was
very obvious what you were about
to do. If I had wanted to stop
you it would have been only too
easy...

SNAPE
Perhaps it would be prudent to
first teach the students to block
unfriendly spells, Professor.

(CONTINUED )

CONTINUED: (2) 70

GILDEROY LOCKHART
An excellent suggestion, Professor
Snape. Let's have a volunteer
pair. Potter, Weasley, how about
you?

SNAPE
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells. We'll
be sending Potter to the hospital
wing in a matchbox. Might I
Suggest someone from my own house.
Malfoy, perhaps.

Malfoy and Harry eye each other malevolently as they take
their places onstage. Grudgingly, they bow to each
other.

DRACO
Scared, Potter?

HARRY
You wish.

They turn, walk ten paces, then WHIRL, wands poised.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Wands at the ready! When I count
to three, cast your charms to
disarm your opponent -- only to
disarm. We don't want any
accidents. One, two -
Malfoy FIRES early, knocking Harry off his feet with a
BLAST of WHITE LIGHT. He jumps up, points his wand.

HARRY
Rictusempra!

A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach.
He doubles up, WHEEZING.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
I said disarm only!

DRACO
Serpensortia!

To Harry's horror, the tip of Malfoy's wand EXPLODES and
a LONG BLACK SNAKE SLITHERS forth. Snape smiles with
amusement.

SNAPE
Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid
of it for you.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Allow me!

Lockhart flicks his wand. BANG! The SNAKE flies into
the air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight towards
Justin Finch-Fletchley. As students SCREAM, Harry -oddly calm -- approaches the snake. It rises, fangs
exposed, poised to strike Justin.

HARRY
(in Parseltongue)
Leave him!

The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.

HARRY
(in Parseltongue)
LEAVE HIM!
The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously -
slumps to the floor. Harry blinks, as if coming out of a
trance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his hand
to Justin.

JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY
What are you playing at?

Terrified, Justin backs away. Confused, Harry eyes the
faces around him. Malfoy looks shocked. Seamus and
Neville's eyes glitter with fear. Ginny bolts the room.
Snape waves his wand and the snake VANISHES in PUFF OF
BLACK SMOKE, then regards Harry with a look that is both
shrewd and calculating.

RON
(taking Harry's arm)
Come on. Move. Now.

INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM —- DAY (LATER) 71

Ron and Hermione usher Harry inside. Harry glances up,
sees Ginny Weasley staring down at him from the top of
the stairs. As their eyes meet, she turns for the girls'
dormitory.

RON
You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't
you tell us?

HARRY
T'm a what?

HERMIONE
You can talk to snakes.

HARRY
I know. I mean, I accidentally
set a python on my cousin Dudley
at the zoo once. But so what? I
bet loads of people here can do
it.

HERMIONE
No. They can't. It's not a very
common gift, Harry. This is bad.

HARRY
What's bad? If I hadn't told that
snake not to attack Justin -
RON
Oh, that's what you said to it.

HARRY
You were there! You heard me!

RON
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

HARRY
I spoke a different language? But
I didn't realize -- how can I
speak a language without knowing I
can?

HERMIONE

I don't know, Harry. But it
sounded like you were egging the
snake on or something. It was...
creepy.

As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harry
warily. Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk by

without a

word.

HERMIONE
Harry, listen out me. There's a
reason the symbol of Slytherin
house is a serpent. Salazar
Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He
could talk to snakes too.

HERMIONE
He lived a thousand years ago.
For all we know... you could be.

EXT. HOGWARTS' LANDSCAPE - DAY 72

A heavy snow falls. Harry sits atop one of the towering
hills facing Hogwarts. Hedwig sits beside him.

HARRY
Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?

INT. LIBRARY —- NIGHT 73

The trio study. Harry, burdened by dark thoughts, looks
up at Ron.

He smiles at Harry, then, seconds later, Hermione does
the same -- something forced about it all. Unable to
bear it, Harry gathers his books, gets up from the table.

As Harry walks, students glance up, meet his gaze, then
look away. Even MADAM PINCE eyes him from her desk.
Ginny Weasley, tired and pale, scribbles furiously ina
SMALL BLACK BOOK.

Harry exits, walks into the hallway and pauses. From
inside a room, the VOICES of a group of Hufflepuffs can
be heard.

ERNIE
So, anyway, I told Justin to hide
up in our dormitory. I mean to

say, if Potter's marked him down
as his next victim, it's best he
keep a low profile for a while.

Justin?

Justin let it slip to Potter that
he was Muggle-born.

HANNAH
And you definitely think Potter's
the Heir of Slytherin?

ERNIE

Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.
Everyone knows that's the mark of
a dark wizard. Have you ever
heard of a decent one who could
talk to snakes? They called
Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.

(whispering darkly)
Remember what was written on the
wall: Enemies of the Heir Beware.
Potter had some sort of run-in
with Filch. Next thing we know,
Filch's cat's attacked. That
first-year Creevey's been annoying
Potter. Then Creevey's attacked.

HANNAH
He always seems so nice, though.
And, after all, he is the one who
made You Know Who disappear.

ERNIE
That's probably why You Know Who
wanted to kill him in the first
place. Didn't want another Dark
Lord competing with him.

Harry doesn't need to hear anymore. He slips quietly
away.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 74

MUTTERING, Harry storms straight into Hagrid, who
stands covered in snow, a DEAD ROOSTER dangling from
his hand.

HARRY
It's nothing. I'd better get
going. I've got a lot of
studying...

INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 75

Harry enters, slows. Up ahead, in the light of a
FLICKERING TORCH, something DARK lies. A WINDOWPANE
RATTLES in the WIND and the torch... goes out. Harry
steps closer, finds...

Justin-Finch-Fletchley. Lying rigid on the floor, a look
of shock on his frozen face. Nearby, an inert Nearly
Headless Nick floats, body teeming with BLACK SMOKE.
Kneeling, Harry notices a TRAIL OF SPIDERS scuttling away
from Justin's body and out the loose windowpane... when
suddenly...

... Harry senses someone watching him, wheels:
McGonagall.

HARRY
Professor, I swear I didn’t -
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
This is out of my hands, Potter.
Mr. Filch, will you take care of
this, please?

Harry's eyes shift. Filch lurks in the shadows beyond
McGonagall. He steps forward, HISSES QUIETLY.

FILCH
Caught in the act. I'll have you
out this time, Potter. Mark my
words...

As McGonagall leads Harry away, he looks back. Filch
stares at Justin and Nick, then turns. CAMERA DOLLYS

McGonagall marches Harry down to an UGLY STONE GARGOYLE.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sherbet lemon.

The Gargoyle SPRINGS TO LIFE, its wings opening.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Professor Dumbledore will be
waiting for you.

McGonagall ushers Harry inside. It's an elevator. The
Gargoyle's wings close. Harry rises to an upper floor.

INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 77

Harry steps out of the Gargoyle's embrace and enters a
large, circular room. STRANGE SILVER INSTRUMENTS WHIR
quietly. On a nearby shelf, the SORTING HAT sits. Harry
casts a wary eye at the PAST HEADMASTERS snoozing in the
PORTRAITS around him. In the last portrait, the
Headmaster is awake, reading a book. He is PROFESSOR
DIPPET. Harry approaches the Sorting Hat, glances
around, then places it atop his head.

SORTING HAT
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

HARRY
Well, you see, I was wondering...

SORTING HAT
If I put you in the right house?
Yes... you were particularly
difficult to place. But I stand
by what I said last year... you
would have done well in Slytherin.

Harry strips the hat off, tosses it back onto the shelf.

HARRY
You're wrong!

The hat sits motionless. Silent. Hearing a GAGGING
SOUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD (FAWKES)
Sitting on a GOLDEN PERCH. It wobbles, then... BURSTS
INTO FLAMES. As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horrorstruck.

HARRY
Professor, your bird... I couldn't
do anything... He just caught
fire.

DUMBLEDORE

About time too. He's been looking
dreadful for days. Pity you had
to see him on a Burning Day. He's
really very handsome most of the
time.

(off Harry's look)
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
Phoenixes burst into flame when it
is time for them to die and are
reborn from the ashes.

Harry looks to the floor. The ASHES swirl. A baby
Fawkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through the
dust.

DUMBLEDORE
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy
loads, their tears have healing
powers, and they make highly
faithful pets.

Just then, Hagrid -- still clutching the dead rooster -BURSTS through the door.

Then you must have some idea who's

But my father did say this much:
It's been fifty years since the
Chamber was opened. He wouldn't
tell me who opened it -- only that
they were expelled -- but I know
this: the last time the Chamber
of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood
died.

Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts,

possible he knew where the Chamber
was, how to open it, even what

so, whoever's behind the attacks

That's a brilliant theory,
Hermione. With just one tiny
little flaw. There's nothing
written in this diary.

The ink BLAZES briefly, then... VANISHES... as if it were
sucked into the page. Excited, Harry dips his quill
again, and, this time, writes: My name is Harry Potter.

(TOM RIDDLE) at the end of the corridor, peering around a
corner. A FLURRY of SHADOWS dances on the wall beyond
the boy, revealing the presence of others, unseen, in an
adjoining room.

As Harry advances, LOW VOICES emanate from the shadows.
As he reaches the boy, Harry speaks in a WHISPER:

That remains to be seen, but as
all twelve governors have voted -
HAGRID
An' how many did yeh have ter
threaten before they agreed!

LUCIUS MALFOY
I would advise you not to shout at
the Azkaban guards like that.

HAGRID
Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him
away an' the Muggle-borns won'
stand a chance! There'll be
killin's next!

DUMBLEDORE

Calm yourself, Hagrid!

(steely-eyed)
If the governors want my removal,
Lucius, I shall of course step
aSide. However... you will find
that I will only truly have left
this school when none here are
loyal to me. You will also find
that help will always be given at

Hogwarts to those who... ask for
it.
Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Admirable sentiments. We shall
all miss your highly individual
way of running things, Albus, and
only hope your successor will
manage to prevent any more, um,
killin's.

Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out.
Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waits for Hagrid.
Instead, Hagrid stands his ground, takes a deep breath
and says carefully...

HAGRID
If anyone wanted ter find out some
stuff, all they'd have ter do is
follow the spiders. That'd lead
‘em right! Tha's all I'm sayin’.

Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him
out. As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL,
scratching at the closed door. Harry and Ron emerge from
the cloak.

RON
Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore
gone, there'll be an attack a day.

HARRY
Look...

At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a
crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.

HARRY

Harry illuminates the TRAIL OF SPIDERS. They run from
the window to the ground, to the dark trees in the near
distance. As Harry moves to follow, Ron hesitates.

RON
What are you doing?

HARRY
You heard Hagrid. Follow the
Spiders.

RON
They're heading into the Dark
Forest.

Harry sighs, heads off. Terrified, Ron grabs Fang,
follows.

RON

Why spiders. Why couldn't it be
‘Follow the butterflies'?

EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT 121

Fang crashes through low-slung branches and sharp
brambles as Harry follows. Ron gingerly picks his way,

the JUMPS... as FANG HOWLS. BRANCHES SNAP. A RUMBLING
NOISE sounds, then... SILENCE. Harry spies something,
points O.S.
HARRY
There's something moving over
there... something big.

Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding

them. They start to flee... when Ron stops.
RON
Harry!... Harry, it's our car!

Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass
Sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford
Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.

Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.

HARRY
C'mon, we don't want to lose the
trail.
EXT. SPIDERS' HOLLOW - NIGHT 121A

Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows.
Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of
white webbing. Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off
queasily. Harry peers up ahead: at the far end of the
hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING.

As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND
emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall
trees. GROWING LOUDER. Ron falters, glancing about
nervously.

RON
I don't have a good feeling about
this, Harry -
HARRY
Don't panic.

As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR
suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE
SHADOW emerges, Slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.
SEES:

An ANCIENT SPIDER (ARAGOG), the size of a small elephant.
As it advances, Harry and Ron back slowly away. Then:
its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS. As if...
listening.

ARAGOG
You do not come from the forest.
Your hearts beat like... men.
HARRY

(breathing finally)
Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you... you're...

(as it comes to him)
... Aragog, aren't you?

Hearing this, Aragog's head turns slightly.

ARAGOG
Hagrid has never sent men into our
hollow before.

HARRY
He's in trouble. Up at school,
there've been attacks. They think
it's Hagrid. They think he's
opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Like before.

As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then...

RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl
slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left.

Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.
ARAGOG

That's a lie! Hagrid never opend
the Chamber of Secrets!

HARRY
But if Hagrid never... that
means... you're not the monster.
ARAGOG

The monster was born in the
castle. I came from a distant
land, in the pocket of a traveler.

Ron turns. TWO CRAWLING SILHOUETTES inch forward.
Pause. Waiting. Watching.

RON
Harry...
HARRY
Shhh!
(to Aragog)

But if you're not the monster,
what did kill that girl fifty
years ago?

ARAGOG
We do not speak of it! It is an
ancient creature we spiders fear
above all others.

A SCRABBLING SOUND ECHOES above Ron. He GLANCES UP: a
SPIDER crouches on a branch above.

ARAGOG
I never saw any part of the castle
but the cupboard in which Hagrid
kept me. The girl was discovered
in a bathroom. When I was
accused, Hagrid brought me here.

More SCRABBLING. Ron looks up. We PAN UP with him.
SEE: SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING
DOWNWARD like paratroopers. Ron GRABS Harry.

HARRY
(annoyed)
What!

Ron points. Harry looks. Pales. Turns slowly back to
Aragog.

HARRY
Well... thank you. We'll just
go...

ARAGOG

Go? I think not. My sons and
daughters do not harm Hagrid, on
my command. But I cannot deny
them fresh meat when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.

Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.

RON
Can we panic now?

CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of
FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move
forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again: SPIDERS.
Everywhere. CLOSING IN.

Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand. The
Spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of
the LIGHT chases itself away. Around and around. Then:

The LANTERN goes out.

Harry pitches it aside. As one, he and Ron draw their
wands.

--.- a LONG, LOUD HORN BLEATS. Seconds later, a BLAZE of
LIGHT ignites the hollow and the FORD ANGLIA comes
THUNDERING over the rim and down the slope, KNOCKING
SPIDERS OUT OF ITS PATH. As it SCREECHES to a halt, the
DOORS FLING OPEN.

HARRY
Let's go!

Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY.
A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.

HARRY
THE WINDOWS! ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!

RON
(trying)
I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK!

Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window.
Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE.

Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows
hold tight. As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the
hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his
SPIDER'S LEGS.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST —- NIGHT 121B

The Anglia jets out of the hollow, lands with a THUD.
Harry turns. The other spider is PULLING RON from the
car. Harry points his wand, utters a spell anda
BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT BLASTS the spider into the
shadows whipping past.

They stop. Both hear it: a DISTANT CLICKING. As the
car flies over a ridge, they see them: a SEA OF SPIDERS
heading straight for them like a herd of raging
Wildebeest. Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the
wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders
STAMPEDE after.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - BLACK PARK —- NIGHT 121C

The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past
trees as the spiders CHARGE after. Harry peers ahead,
SEES an area of FALLEN TREES. There is an OPENING, one
narrow escape route.

HARRY
That way! It's the only way out!
(looking back)
Hurry! They're catching up!

Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA
drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as
good as dead.

HARRY
Can you get us in the air?

RON
(jostling the
gear stick)
Flying gear's jammed!

The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER. The TARANTULA waits
ahead. Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear
shift, pushing. The tarantula's pincers open, ready to
kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels
LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious
Spiders below. The car barely avoids the rearing
tarantula, then sails over the trees.

Ron shifts uncomfortably.

RON

We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's

A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.

As she exits, the boys step to her bed. Absently, Ron
picks up the circular mirror that lies on the nightstand.

Hermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over her

fingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutched
there.
INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (LATER) 124

Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLED
paper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.

HARRY

‘Of the many fearsome beasts that
roam our land, none is more deadly
than the Basilisk. Capable of
living for hundreds of years,
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye. Spiders
flee before it and only the
crowing of the rooster can kill
it.'

(looking up)
Ron! This is it! The monster in
the Chamber of Secrets is a
Basilisk. That's why I can hear
it speak. It's a snake.

RON
But it kills by looking people in
the eye. Why is it no one's dead?

Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and
Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutters
SOFTLY:

HARRY

Because no one did look it in the
eye. Not directly at least...

(in a rush)
Colin saw it through his camera.

HARRY

The water... there was water on

The crowing of the rooster is

But how's the Basilisk been

snake. Someone would have seen...

Hermione answered that too.

Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is:

"Pipes."

sense. My books wouldn't have

No one wants to read about some

he did save a village from
werewolves. He'd look dreadful on

You're a fraud! You've just been

pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and
turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the
damp floor of a stone tunnel.

fingers.

HARRY
Give me my wand, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE
You won't be needing it.

HARRY
Listen, we've got to go! We've
got to save her!

TOM RIDDLE
I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry.
You see, aS poor Ginny grows
weaker... I grow stronger.

HARRY
But she's dying!

TOM RIDDLE
Yes. I'm afraid so. But then,
she's been in so much pain, poor
Ginny. She's been writing to me
for months, telling me all her
pitiful worries and woes. Ginny
poured her soul out to me. I grew
stronger on a diet of her deepest
fears, her darkest secrets. I
grew powerful enough to start
feeding Ginny a few secrets, to
start pouring a bit of my soul
back into her...

Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins
cruelly.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

HARRY
No... she couldn't -- she
wouldn't.

TOM RIDDLE
It was Ginny who set the Basilisk
on the Mudbloods and the Squib's
cat. Ginny who wrote threatening
messages on the walls.

HARRY
But... Why?...

TOM RIDDLE
Because I told her to. You'll
find that I can be very
persuasive. Not that she knew
what she was doing. She was,
shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her and she tried
to dispose of it in the girls'
bathroom. But then, who should
find it... but you. The very
person I was most anxious to meet.

HARRY
(getting angry)
And why did you want to meet me?

TOM RIDDLE
Ginny told me all about you. I
knew I had to talk to you, meet
you if I could. So I decided to
show you my capture of that
brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain
your trust.

HARRY
Hagrid's my friend. And you
framed him, didn't you?

TOM RIDDLE
It was my word against Hagrid's.
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
Hagrid was innocent.

HARRY
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right
through you.

TOM RIDDLE
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
the Chamber again while I was
still at school. So I decided to
leave behind a diary, preserving
my Sixteen-year-old self in its
pages, so that one day... I would
be able to lead another to finish
Salazar Slytherin's noble work.

HARRY
Well, you haven't finished it this
time. In a few hours Mandrake

Draught will be ready and everyone
who was petrified will be all
right again.

TOM RIDDLE

Haven't I told you, that killing
Mudbloods doesn't matter to me
anymore? For many months now, my
new target has been... you.

(grinning)
Imagine my disappointment when I
learned Ginny had stolen the diary
back from you.

HARRY
Ginny stole the diary from my
room? But why?

TOM RIDDLE
She was afraid. Afraid you'd
learn how to work the diary.
Afraid I'd tell you just who it
was that had been strangling all
those roosters.

Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE,
then back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.

TOM RIDDLE
Come now, Harry. Don't look so
disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded
in destroying the diary, she would
have destroyed me. And we
couldn't be having this little
talk. And I have so many
questions for you.

HARRY
Like what?

TOM RIDDLE
Well, how is it that a baby with
no extraordinary magical talent
managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you
escape with nothing but a scar,
while Lord Voldemort's powers were
destroyed?

HARRY
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

TOM RIDDLE
Voldemort is my past, present and
future.

Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to
trace it through the air, writing three words: "TOM
MARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them:
"I AM LORD VOLDEMORT. "

HARRY
You. You're the heir of
Slytherin. You're Voldemort?

TOM RIDDLE
Surely you didn't think I would
keep my filthy Muggle father's
name?

TOM RIDDLE (CONT'D)
No, I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere
would one day fear to speak, when
I became the greatest sorcerer in
the world.

HARRY
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest
sorcerer in the world!

TOM RIDDLE
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of
me.

HARRY
He'll never be gone! Not as long
as those who remain are loyal to
him!

Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep
within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over
the rock. Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix. The
bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE
in its golden talons.

HARRY
Fawkes.

Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which
is the SORTING HAT, at his feet. Riddle picks it up.

TOM RIDDLE
(giggling)
This is what Dumbledore sends his
defender! A songbird and an old
hat!

Riddle tosses aside the hat. He turns to the statue of
Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.

TOM RIDDLE
(Parseltongue )
Speak to me, Slytherin.

Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS. There is a
RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING.
Harry turns away. The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills
out, uncoiling heavily to the floor. Harry turns to the
wall. The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall.
PAN TO Tom Riddle, looking at Harry.

Harry Potter, shall we?

Riddle turns, to serpent, speaking in Parseltongue.
TOM RIDDLE
(Parseltongue )
Kill him!
The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward. Harry turns, RUNS away.
TOM RIDDLE

Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me.

HARRY
(to himself)
Don't look. Don't look into its

eyes.

Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent
is FASTER. Harry TRIPS. FALLS. The Basilisk RISES.
Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike.

Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk
and circling its blunt head, confusing it. The SNAKE
SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife,
driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering
eyes.

As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall,
the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain. Fawkes wings away,
its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS:
the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.

TOM RIDDLE
Fool! Think you're safe! It can
still hear you!

As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING
BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE.
Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about to

Strike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDE
TUNNEL.
INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT 133A

Harry RACES HEADLONG into the shadows, then looks back,
sees the snake eclipse the light at the far end of the
tunnel and SLITHER QUICKLY inside.

Thinking, Harry DUCKS INTO AN ALCOVE, puts his hand over
his mouth and waits, desperate to remain STILL and
SILENT. The snake slides heavily by, then... SLOWS.
TURNS BACK.

The snake's head weaves inside, only INCHES from Harry's

face. Harry trembles as the snake's head cocks to the
Side, then... finally... WITHDRAWS.

INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT 133B

Harry DASHES back into the main chamber. Ginny looks

frighteningly pale. Riddle GRINS cruelly, almost SOLID
now.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, Potter. The process is
nearly complete. Ina few
minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead. And I will cease to be a
memory. Lord Voldemort will
return. Very much... alive.

Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK
SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of
Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then -impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue
of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but
Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what
glitters within: the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD.

Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing
serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of
courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN
its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee,
Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS
BARED... STRIKES.

Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry
drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the
SERPENT'S mouth. It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as
it drives a FANG into Harry's arm. Harry clutches his
arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor,
watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes
STILL.

Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the
blood soaking slowly into his robe. As he yanks the fang
free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now. His
eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.

TOM RIDDLE
Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly
the venom of the Basilisk
penetrates the body? If you have
any final words, Potter, you'd
best speak them now. I'd guess
you have little more than a minute
to live.

Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearm
turns a troubling gray.

As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly white
now, a small ghost, the only evidence of life the
TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER. Harry studies the finger
and what lies beneath it: Tom Riddle's diary. Harry
begins to crawl toward her.

Funny, isn't it? The damage a

Especially in the hands of a silly
little girl.

As Harry reaches Ginny, he places his hand on hers,
then... Slips the diary free.

TOM RIDDLE
What are you doing? No. Stop...

Riddle's face creases in fear. He LUNGES FORWARD. But
Harry is too guick. Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES
THE FANG into the book. Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from
the pages.

TOM RIDDLE
No!

Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins to
Wither instantly, growing BLURRY once more. As the ink
runs off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHES
altogether. Harry sinks back, then... hears a FAINT
MOAN. Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks. As she
sees Harry, she SOBS.

GINNY
Harry. It was me! But I swear, I
didn't mean to... Riddle made me.
He wrote to me... took me over...
I didn't even know whose diary it
was. I found it inside my
cauldron. The day we all went to
Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're
hurt...

HARRY
Ginny. You need to get yourself
out... Follow the chamber...
You'll find Ron...

There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays
his head onto Harry's arm.

HARRY
You were brilliant, Fawkes. I
just... wasn't quick enough.

Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS are
trickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm. Almost
instantly, his wound... begins to heal itself.

With Fawkes gliding gracefully ahead of them, Harry and
Ginny make their way back. Up ahead, SHIFTING ROCK can
be heard and a jagged fissure of LIGHT GLIMMERS. Ron's
face appears.

RON

Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.

RON
You're alive. I can't believe it.

GINNY

Remind you of anyone?

HARRY

Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMING
placidly.

RON
His Memory Charm backfired.
Hasn't got a clue who he is. I

keep having to stop him wandering
off. He's a danger to himself.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Hello. Odd sort of place, this,

Harry and Ron, covered in muck and slime -- stand in

Dumbledore's office. Fawkes perches on a pedestal behind
Dumbledore, who sits at his desk, examining the charred
diary. He looks up, regarding Harry and Ron gravely.

DUMBLEDORE
Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.
(looking up)

Of course, Tom Riddle was probably
the most brilliant student
Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught
him myself fifty years ago. After
he left, I would occasionally hear
stories of his activities -- dark
rumors -- but after awhile, even
the rumors stopped. When he
finally resurfaced as Lord
Voldemort, most people had
completely forgotten the clever
Head Boy he'd once been.

I didn't know whose diary it was,
Sir. I swear. I found it inside

Wiser wizards than you have been
hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss
Weasley. No, I think you've
endured enough. I would suggest a
bit of bed rest, however. And
perhaps a large mug of hot
chocolate. I always find that
cheers me up. Minerva, will you
Show Arthur and Molly up to the
hospital wing?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Certainly, Albus.

As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go. Mrs.
Weasley's VOICE carries:

MRS. WEASLEY
A diary that writes back to you!
Honestly, Ginny! What were you
thinking? Haven't I always told
you? Never trust anything that
can think for itself if you can't
see where it keeps its brain!

Harry and Ron turn back. See Dumbledore regarding them
gravely.

DUMBLEDORE
You two realize, of course, that
in the last few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school
rules?

First, Harry, I want to thank you.
You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber.
Nothing but that could have called
Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense

mistaken, he transformed some of
his own powers to you the night he
gave you that scar.

HARRY
Voldemort put a bit of himself in
me?
DUMBLEDORE
Not intentionally, but... yes.
HARRY

So the Sorting Hat was right. I
should be a Slytherin.

DUMBLEDORE
It's true, Harry. You do possess
many of the gualities Voldemort
himself prizes. Resourcefulness.
Determination. A certain
disregard for the rules. Yet the
Sorting Hat placed you in
Gryffindor.

HARRY
Only because I asked it to.

DUMBLEDORE

Exactly. Which makes you very
different from Voldemort. It's
not our abilities that show what
we truly are, Harry. It's our
choices.

(smiling at him)
If you want proof that you belong
in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest
you look more closely at this.

Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry. An
ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.

Dobby nods, chagrined. Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Out of my way, Potter.
(to Dumbledore)
So! You've returned!

DUMBLEDORE

Yes. When the governors heard
that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
been taken into the Chamber, they
saw fit to summon me back.

(a wry smile)
Curiously, several of them seemed
under the impression that you
would curse their families if they
didn't agree to suspend me in the
first place, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY
From the beginning, my only
concern has been the welfare of
this school and its students.
I assume the culprit has been
identified.

DUMBLEDORE
Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only
this time, he chose to act through
someone else. By means of...
this.

As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy,
Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to
Lucius.

Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter

close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:

where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly.
Petunia flicks a bit of fluff from Dudley's sweater,
glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the
door.

AUNT PETUNIA
Well, go on. Open it.

Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS
OPEN, revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and
a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle Vernon lurches

forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in
hand, and drops it on Harry.

AUNT PETUNIA
Marge! Welcome! How was the
train?

AUNT MARGE
Wretched. Ripper got sick.

AUNT PETUNIA
Ah. How... unfortunate.

AUNT MARGE
I would've left him with the
others, but he pines so when I'm
away. Don't you, darling?

Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down
the hallway. Harry follows with Uncle Vernon.

HARRY
Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign
this form.

UNCLE VERNON
What is it?

HARRY
Nothing. Something for school...

Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in Harry's hand
suspiciously.

UNCLE VERNON
Later perhaps. If you behave.

HARRY
I will if she does.

AUNT MARGE
(turning, eyeing Harry)
So. Still here, are you?

HARRY
Yes.

AUNT MARGE
Don’t say ‘yes' in that ungrateful
tone. Damn good of my brother to
keep you, if you ask me.

(to Vernon, Petunia)

It'd have been straight to an
orphanage if he'd been dumped on
my doorstep.

Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV -emits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.

AUNT MARGE
Is that my Dudders! Hm? [Is that
my neffy poo? Come and say hello
to your Auntie Marge.

Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks,
waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently.
Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his
ankle.

As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a
bottle of brandy.

UNCLE VERNON
Can I tempt you, Marge?

AUNT MARGE

Just a small one. A bit more...a
bit more... That's the boy.
(taking a
sloppy sip)

Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia.
It's normally just a fry-up for
me, what with twelve dogs.

She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Ripper
take a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catches
Harry looking.

AUNT MARGE
What are you smirking at! Where
is it that you send him, Vernon?

UNCLE VERNON
St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases.

Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who
glares darkly at him.

AUNT MARGE
I see. And do they use the cane
at St. Brutus's, boy?

HARRY
(sarcastically)
Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads
of times.

AUNT MARGE

Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense
about not hitting people who
deserve it.

(another sip)
Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
how this one's turned out, Vernon.
It all comes down to blood. Bad
blood will out. What is it the
boy's father did, Petunia?

AUNT PETUNIA

(agitated)
Nothing. That is... he didn't
work. He was -- unemployed.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED: (2)

AUNT MARGE
Of course. And a drunk,
I expect -
HARRY
That's a lie.

Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.

AUNT MARGE
What did you say?

HARRY
My dad wasn't a drunk.

POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.

AUNT PETUNIA
Oh my goodness! Marge!

AUNT MARGE
Not to worry, Petunia. I have a
very firm grip.

Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise.

UNCLE VERNON
You go to bed. Now.

AUNT MARGE
Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter
about the father. In the end it
comes down to the mother. You see
it all the time with dogs. If
there's something wrong with the
bitch, there'll be something wrong
with the pup...

HARRY
Shut up! Shut up!

Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON on
her dress sails into the air. SEAMS GROAN. THREAD
SNAPS. Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN. Her cheeks BILLOW. Her
whole body BILLOWS. And she begins to INFLATE like a
MONSTROUS BALLOON.

UNCLE VERNON
MARGE !

As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her. RIPPER GROWLS,
fixes his teeth to his trousers. Harry frightened by
what he's done, watches Aunt Marge BOUNCE GENTLY across
the ceiling and into the CONSERVATORY.

UNCLE VERNON

Slowly... to his horror... Uncle Vernon himself begins to
RISE. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes...

AUNT MARGE
Vernon. Don't you dare -
But he does. He lets go. Falls to his knees. And
watches Aunt Marge float away.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 8

Harry crashes inside, takes his TRUNK, then puts his heel
to a LOOSE FLOORBOARD and removes his WAND from its
hiding place. Turning, he grabs the PHOTOGRAPH of his
parents.

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the TRUNK down the
Stairs... finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him.

UNCLE VERNON
YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER
BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!

HARRY
No! She deserved what she got!
And you... you keep away from me.

Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with
knowing cruelty.

UNCLE VERNON
You're not allowed to do magic out
of school. They won't have you
now. You've got nowhere to go.

Harry realizes it's true. Briefly falters. Then:
HARRY
Anywhere's better than here.

As Harry storms out with his trunk, we DOLLY TO the

street WITH him. High in the sky, a plump DOT rises.
Aunt Marge.

EXT. MAGNOLIA CRESCENT - NIGHT (LATER) 10

Harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops. Glances
about. An empty PLAYGROUND. SWINGS CREAKING gently on
rusted chains. A tiny CAROUSEL, kissed gently by the
wind, turning slowly.

Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Deep in the night, an
ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT. Harry, still as a statue.
Listening. In the trees above, LEAVES TREMBLE. The WIND
gathers.

Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.
Then, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something in
the shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draws
his wand.

Then he sees... it. Something BIG. Darker than the
shadows which conceal it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING
EYES.

Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Afraid not to. Wand
outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten
trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES.

BANG! TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night.

HARRY
Aaaah!

GIANT WHEELS bear down. Harry rolls clear -- just as a
PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a
halt. GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the windscreen: The
Knight Bus.

DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty
face. Raccoon eyes. Stan looks like he hasn't seen the
sun in years.

STAN SHUNPIKE

(wearily, drearily)
Welcome to the Knight Bus.
Emergency transport for the
stranded witch or wizard. My name
is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this evening.

STAN SHUNPIKE
Well, come on then. Let's not

As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows

across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs
aboard.
INT. THE KNIGHT BUS -—- NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 11

No seats. Only BEDS. The BRASS frames need a shine, the
lines a wash. In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS,
turns over in his sleep.

DISHEVELED WIZARD
Not now... I'm pickling slugs...

Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK
GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with
sweat. A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror,
MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace its
mouth.

STAN SHUNPIKE
Take 'er away, Ern.

SHRUNKEN HEAD
Yeah, take it away!

BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide
Six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed
nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly
above his head. Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC
WHIPS past ina blur.

STAN SHUNPIKE
Wot you say your name was again?

HARRY
I didn't.

Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily
Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once
more. Harry brushes the fringe of his hair over his
scar, watches an AMBULANCE -- SIREN WAILING -- careen
past.

STAN SHUNPIKE

Harry hesitates. He hadn't thought about this. Decides.

HARRY
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in
London -
STAN SHUNPIKE
Is it now? Get that, Ern? The
Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH.

SHRUNKEN HEAD
Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from
the pea soup!

As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers
out the windscreen, watches London careering by.

HARRY
Isn't this a bit... dangerous?

STAN SHUNPIKE
Naah. Haven't had an accident
in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?

SHRUNKEN HEAD
Heads up! Little old lady at
twelve o'clock!

Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is
crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and
Harry flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes
pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and
Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets
forward once more.

As Harry rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of
Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a
sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a
MOVING PHOTOGRAPH.

HARRY
Who is that? That man.

STAN SHUNPIKE
Who is that? That's Sirius Black,
that is. Don' tell me you ne'er

been hearin' o' Sirius Black?

Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face.

STAN SHUNPIKE
A murderer, he is. Got ‘imself
locked up in Azkaban for it.

HARRY
How'd he escape?

STAN SHUNPIKE
Tha's the question, isn't it?
He's the firs' that's done it.
Gives me the collywobbles thinking
he's out there, though, I'll tell
you that. Big supporter of YouKnow-'Oo, Black was. Reckon you
heard o' him.

Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Meet
Harry's.

HARRY
Yeah. Him I've heard of.

Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly
toward the Knight Bus. Before can scream, the entire
Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the
two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces.

SHRUNKEN HEAD
Hate that.

HARRY
This bus. Don't the Muggles ever...

STAN SHUNPIKE
Them! Don' listen properly, do
they? Don' look properly either.
Never notice nuffink, they don’.

Just then, a COUPLE walking a DOG are engulfed by a RUSH
of WIND as the (invisible) Knight Bus WHOOSHES past. The
couple glances about in bewilderment. The DOG YAPS
madly.

SHRUNKEN HEAD
Turn! Turn!

Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a
dizzying 360-degree turn. HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the
windows as the bus rides up on two wheels and Harry is
sent flying once more. Grabbing fast to the center POLE,
he pirouettes through the air when Ernie... SLAMS on the
BRAKES.

ALARM wails.

The steps GROAN with heavy feet and a FIGURE appears:

EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON —- NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 12B

As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are
revealed, Harry glances up, reads the SIGN above: THE
LEAKY CAULDRON. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then
pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car
alarm.

INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BAR/HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS 13

Harry trails Tom through the guiet room. The BARTENDER
glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A
solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his
COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF. Tom leads Harry upstairs.

INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BACK ROOM —- NIGHT 14

As Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a SNOW WHITE OWL
(HEDWIG) perched atop a chair.

HARRY
Hedwig!

TOM
Right smart bird you've got there,
Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes
before yourself.

A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED
SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE) at the window, staring at
the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers
in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a
position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his
palms.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
I should tell you, Mr. Potter,
earlier this evening your uncle's
Sister was located just south of
Sheffield, circling a chimney
Stack. The Accidental Magic
Reversal Department was dispatched
and she's been properly punctured
and
her memory modified. She has no
recollection of the incident
whatsoever.

Harry waits. A man condemned. Then Fudge turns.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
So that's that, and no harm done.
(smiling)
Pea soup?

Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to
Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut
sliver.

HARRY
No thank you. Minister... I don't
understand. I broke the law.
Underage wizards aren't allowed to
use magic at home -
CORNELIUS FUDGE

(dishing up a bowl)
Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban for
blowing up their aunts! On the
other hand... running away like
that... given the state of
things... very, very
irresponsible.

HARRY
'The state of things' sir?

CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.

By the way, Harry. Whilst you're

PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Harry, standing
with Hedwig. He turns, eyes his schoolbooks. He studies
the GROWLING TOME -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then
gives the rope a tug. Instantly...

-.. the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers
SNAPPING. Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins
NIPPING viciously at his shoes. Harry vaults atop the
bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a
PILLOW.

Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry
POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled
beneath the pillow. Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to
rebind it.

HERMIONE (0.S.)
He's a cat, Ronald! What do you

As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY
protectively cradling Scabbers, while HERMIONE GRANDER
does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks.

RON
A cat! Is that what they told
you? Looks more like a pig with

HERMIONE
That's rich coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

With a DESPERATE GASP, Harry opens his eyes. Blinks.
DUSK IS GONE. The windows BLACK. The floor at his spine
is SHAKING GENTLY. The train moving again. His eyes
shift, see a DROP OF WATER, newly unfrozen, running
slowly down the window.

HERMIONE
Harry? Harry, are you all right?

Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. He nods.
Sits up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand.
Harry's glasses.

HARRY
Thanks.

Harry slips them on. Discovers the cold sweat glazing
his brow. SNAP! Professor Lupin breaks a ragged
triangle of CHOCOLATE off the SLAB in his hands. Holds
it out.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Chocolate. Eat. It'll help.

HARRY
What was that -- that thing?

PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Dementor. One of the guards of
Azkaban. It's gone now.

Harry frowns in confusion.

HERMIONE
It was searching the train, Harry.
For Sirius Black.

No. I felt... weird. Like I'd
never be cheerful again. But...

Harry turns to Hermione. She shakes her head.

HERMIONE
I was trembling. Cold. But

away...

HARRY
But someone was screaming. A

Hermione and Ron glance nervously at each other.

No one was screaming, Harry.

At the High Table, Lupin sits with SEVERUS SNAPE, MINERVA
McGONAGALL, RUBEUS HAGRID and ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. We TRACK
ALONG the FACES of the choir, Singing to the strains of a
HARPSICHORD, and LAND ON a QUINTET OF TOADS (one of

which -- TREVOR -- belongs to NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, who
looks on with pride).

ARGUS FILCH, Hogwarts' caretaker, stands grimly to the
Side as red-eyed MRS. NORRIS switches her tail at his
feet. As the choir's song concludes, DUMBLEDORE rises,
beaming over the sea of black hats.

DUMBLEDORE
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts! I have a few things

to say, before we become befuddled
by our excellent feast. I myself
am particularly looking forward to
the flaming kiwi cups, which,
while somewhat treacherous for
those of us with facial hair...

McGONAGALL clears her throat.

DUMBLEDORE
Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to
welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who
has kindly consented to fill the
post of Defense Against the Dark
Arts. Good luck to you,
Professor.

Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLAP
LOUDLY.

HERMIONE
Of course! That's why he knew to
give you the chocolate, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE
As some of you may know, Professor
Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
Creatures teacher for many years,
has decided to retire in order to
spend more time with his remaining
limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted
to announce that his place will be

DUMBLEDORE
(turning grave)
Finally, on a more disquieting
note, Hogwarts -- at the request
of the Ministry of Magic -- will,
until further notice, play host to
the Dementors of Azkaban.

A MURMUR of apprehension fills the hall. At the
Slytherin table, DRACO MALFOY, flanked by the everpresent CRABBE and GOYLE, catches Harry's eye, feigns
a dead faint.

DUMBLEDORE
The Dementors will be stationed at
the entrances to the grounds. While
they are under strict orders not to
enter the castle itself, you will on
occasion see them as you go about
your daily activities. Under no
circumstances are you to approach
them. It is not in the nature of
a Dementor to be forgiving.

head playfully, CHIRP-CHIRP-CHIRPING merrily before it...

... flutters off, pin-wheeling past flowers, into a
BIRDBATH, finally coming to rest upon...

As the class exchanges uneasy glances, Trelawney smiles
brightly.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Well then. Shall we?

CUT TO:

TEACUP - DETAIL - LATER

Inside, a CLOUD of TEA LEAVES mutates oddly. Harry,
Sitting opposite Ron now, frowns at the leaves, consults
the SYMBOLS in the textbook (Unfogging the Future) at his
elbow. Trelawney walks amongst them, robes flowing.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Broaden your minds, my dears. And
allow your eyes to see... beyond.

Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
A five-leaf clover... You can
expect to wake with a horrible
rash tomorrow morning, dear.

Mr. Longbottom, after you've
broken your first cup...

Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and

Trelawney regards Harry with a mixture of pity and fear.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

Not the grin, you idiot. The Grim.

EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 43A

STUDENTS gather around Hagrid as Harry, Ron and Hermione
arrive. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stand with the
Slytherins.

HAGRID
C'mon now, get a move on! Gota
real treat for yeh. Great lesson
comin' up. Follow me.

EXT. PADDOCK - HAGRID'S HUT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 44

Hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this side
of the Forbidden Forest. In the paddock, a freestanding
TRON RACK hangs with DEAD FERRETS, BUZZING with FLIES.
Nearby is a PUMPKIN PATCH.

HAGRID
Gather 'round. Find yerself a spot.
That's it. Now, firs' thing yeh'll

Hagrid looks. Belts, rope, Spellotape: any means
available have been employed to bridle The Monster Book
of Monsters, which QUIVER VIOLENTLY.

HAGRID
Crikey. Didn' yeh know? All yeh've
got ter do is stroke 'em. Look -
Hagrid takes Hermione's copy, SNAPS the Spellotape
binding it. As it begins to BITE, Hagrid calmly runs a
forefinger down the book's spine and it... SHIVERS.
Falls quietly open.

Hagrid glances at the class, looking suddenly unsure.

HAGRID
Righ' then. So... so... yeh've
got yer books, an' now yeh need
the Magical Creatures. Right.
So... I'll... I'll go an' get ‘em.

Hagrid turns, disappears into the trees. Draco shakes
his head, SPEAKS LOUDLY to Crabbe and Goyle.

DRACO
God, this place is going to the
dogs. Wait until my father hears
Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching
classes.

HARRY
Listen, you stupid prat -
Eyes WIDENING in fear, Malfoy steps back, points.

DRACO
Potter, there's a Dementor behind
you.
Harry JUMPS, wheels in fear, finds... nothing. Instantly,
the SLYTHERINS make an eerie OOH... and OOH sound, then

break up laughing. Harry reddens, embarrassed, then...

A STRANGE BEAST (BUCKBEAK) emerges from the trees. It
has the torso, hind legs, and tail of a horse, but the
front legs, wings and head of a giant eagle. The
students step back in fear, then Hagrid appears, shooing
the beast on.

HAGRID
Gee up, there!
(grinning)
Beau'iful, isn' he?

There seems no consensus on this, but the students stare
in wary wonder nonetheless. As Hagrid coaxes the beast
to the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily.

RON
Hagrid. Exactly what is that?

HAGRID

A Hippogriff, o' course. Now,
firs' thing yeh gotta know is
they're proud. Easily offended,
Hippogriffs are. Don't never
insult one, ‘cause it migh' be
the las' thing yeh do. Right
then -- who wants ter come an'
say hello?

The entire class STEPS BACK, leaving Harry in front.

HAGRID
Good man, Harry!
Harry looks around, then -- reluctantly -- approaches.
HAGRID
Tha's it. Easy now... stop! MThis

here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want
ter let ‘im make the firs' move.
It's polite, see? Jus' take step
forward, give ‘im a bow, and if
Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed
ter touch him. Ready?

Unsure, Harry nods anyway. Steps forward. And... bows.
Buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily.
Harry waits. And waits...

HAGRID
Back off, Harry! Back off!

Harry starts to step back, when... Buckbeak ducks his
beak. Hagrid sighs, relieved.

HAGRID
Well done, Harry! Go on. Give
‘im a pat.

Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand on

Buckbeak's fierce beak. The class CLAPS. Harry
smiles.

HARRY

Excuse me?

HAGRID
We'll jus' set yeh behind the
Wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull
any feathers out. He won' like
that.

Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's
back, and before Harry's settled, SLAPS Buckbeak's
hindquarters.

HAGRID
Off yeh go!

As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back,
giant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! -they SOAR into the air. Rising higher. And higher.

And higher.

Gradually, Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeak's neck.
Losing himself in the joy of flying. Smiling at the
Sight of his and Buckbeak's SHADOW racing across the
grass below. Circling over the Whomping Willow, past
Hogwarts castle, and then SWOOPING, with heart-stopping
speed, over the Black Lake, Buckbeak's talons tickling
the smooth glass of the water, summoning the GIANT SQUID
to the surface briefly. Hagrid WHISTLES then, and
Buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock,
galloping to a halt. As Harry slides off, the class
CHEERS -- all except Draco, who narrows his eyes
maliciously.

HAGRID
Good work, Harry!
(under his breath)
How'm I doin' me firs' day?

HARRY
Brilliant... Professor.

They both grin, when Draco pushes past them roughly,
strides toward Buckbeak.

Potter can do it, it must be

brute -
HAGRID
Malfoy! No!

In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfoy
freezes. Looks down at the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his
robes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward.

Buckbeak WHIPS AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing
Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry...
realizing what he's done... breathes.
DRACO
It's killed me! It's killed
me!
HAGRID
Calm yerself! Yer fine... jus'

Hagrid looks: a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp
arm.

HERMIONE
Hagrid. He's got to be taken to
a hospital. I'‘1ll go with you,
if you like -
HAGRID
No. I'm the teacher. You all...
you all just... Class dismissed!

And with that, Hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up
Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers
toward the castle.

Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and

As the students exit, chattering loudly, only Harry,

HARRY
(nodding glumly)
Not to mention The Shrieking
Shack, which, according to
Hermione, is the most severely
haunted building in Britain.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Yes, that too...

HARRY
Professor, can I ask you
something?

PROFESSOR LUPIN
You'd like to know why I stopped
you from facing the Boggart.
(off Harry's surprise)
I should think it'd be obvious. I
assumed the Boggart would take the
Shape of Lord Voldemort.

Harry frowns. Lupin studies him curiously.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
But clearly... I was wrong.

HARRY
I did think of Voldemort first.
But then, I remembered that night
on the train... and the
Dementors...

(CONTINUED )
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well, well. I'm impressed. That
Suggests that what you fear most

of all is... fear. Very wise.
HARRY
Before I fainted... I heard

something. A woman. Screaming.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors force us to relive the
worst memories of our lives. Our
pain becomes their power.

HARRY
I think it was my mother. The
night she was murdered.

Harry looks up. Finds Lupin studying him.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
The first time I saw you, Harry, I
recognized you immediately. Not
by your scar. By your eyes.
They're your mother Lily's.

(nodding)

Yes. I knew her. She was there
for me at a time when no one else
was. We used to talk for hours.
She was not only a singularly
gifted witch but an uncommonly
kind woman. She had a way of
seeing the beauty in whoever she
met, even -- and perhaps most
especially -- when that person
couldn't see it in themselves...

Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Which perhaps explains her
affection for your father. James
had, shall we say, a certain
talent for trouble. A gift, rumor
has it, he passed on to you.

Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smiles
vaguely.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

I could tell you stories -- and
there are many about your parents,
Harry -- but know this...

(eyeing Harry intensely)
They lived. Every moment of every
day. You should know that.
That's how they'd want to be
remembered.

INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING (LATER) 56

The Hall buzzes with tales of Hogsmeade, as students swap
stories, sample sweets, and send SOAP BUBBLES of all
shapes, sizes and colors into the air. A MARIONETTE of a
HARLEQUIN cavorts atop the Gryffindor table, moving its
limbs in response to the STRANDS of LIGHT that extend
from Neville's fingertips. Seamus passes his hand
through the light beams and -- FLUMPH! -- the Harlequin
collapses.

RON
And Honeyduke's is brilliant!
Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees -and blood-flavored lollipops for
Halloween!

Harry nods, picking quietly through the spray of
brilliantly colored sweets on the table. Hermione

notices.

HERMIONE
But, I mean, after awhile, it got
a bit boring. Don't you think,
Ron?

RON
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing.
Hang on. I almost forgot. I got
you something wicked at Dervish
and Banges. It's a Pocket
Sneakoscope.

Ron places a SMALL GLASS SPINNING TOP on the table.

RON
If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's meant to light up
and spin. Mind you, Fred and
George say it's rubbish, sold for
wizard tourists, but I thought,
you know, it can't
hurt, given that...

HARRY
Sirius Black's trying to kill me.

Harry looks up, GRINS at the two of them.

With that,

HARRY
I'm glad you had a good time.
Really. And thanks for this.

Rubbish or not, you're right. It

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione climb the stairs, they find a
crowd gathering on the Seventh Floor landing.

RON
What's the hold-up? Only Neville
ever forgets the password.

PERCY

(pushing past)
Let me through, please. Excuse
me, thank you, I'm Head Boy...

(stopping dead)
Back! All of you! No one is to

been fully searched!

Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange dark glances, when...
Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen.

GINNY
The Fat Lady... she's gone.

RON
Probably stuffing her face with
the apples in that still life on
the second floor again.

GINNY
No. You don't understand -
Hermione GASPS. GRABS Harry's arm. He looks. SEES:

The Fat Lady's portrait has been SLASHED VICIOUSLY, great
strips of canvas hanging from the frame. Just then,
Dumbledore appears.

FILCH
There'll be no need for
ghosts, Professor...

Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near the
ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own,
trembling.
DUMBLEDORE
Dear lady. Who did this to you?

FAT LADY
(in a trance)
Eyes like the devil he's got. And
a soul as dark as his name. It
was him, Headmaster. The one they
talk about. He's here. Somewhere
in the castle. Sirius Black.

As the students REACT, Dumbledore's VOICE cuts through.

Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The
rest of you... to the Great Hall.

SNAPE
I've done the dungeons,
Headmaster. No sign of Black.
Nor anywhere else in the castle.

DUMBLEDORE
(nodding)
I didn't really expect him to
linger.
SNAPE

Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts castle on one's
own, completely undetected...

Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the
bait.
SNAPE
You may recall, prior to the start
of term, I did express my concerns
when you appointed Professor -
DUMBLEDORE
I do not believe a single
professor inside this castle
would have helped Sirius
Black enter it, Severus.

As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out over
the slumbering students.

DUMBLEDORE
No... I feel quite confident the
castle is safe. And I'm more than
willing to let the students return
to their Houses. But tomorrow.
For now, let them sleep...

As Dumbledore's gaze finds Harry, he shuts his eyes,
feigns sleep.

DUMBLEDORE
It's astonishing what the body can
endure when the mind allows itself
to rest.

What villains are these that
trespass upon my private lands!

INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM —- MORNING 63

The Fat Lady has been replaced by a PAINTING of a TINY
KNIGHT (SIR CADOGAN). Stalking a bare stretch of grass
as his PONY grazes nearby, he brandishes his sword wildly
as a group of Gryffindors regard him warily.

SIR CADOGAN
Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan!
Back, you scurvy braggarts! You
rogues!

SEAMUS
He's barking mad!

DEAN THOMAS
What d'you expect? After what
happened to the Fat Lady, none of
the other pictures would take the
job.

NEVILLE
But he keeps changing the
password. Twice just this
morning! I've taken to keeping a
list.

As Neville holds up a wrinkled piece of parchment, Harry,
Ron and Hermione begin to exit.

SIR CADOGAN
Farewell, comrades! If ever you

steely sinew, call upon Sir
Cadogan!

RON

Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever

Turn to page 394.

As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy
finishes SCRAWLING something on a bit of PARCHMENT and
balls it up in his hands. As he opens them, a MOTH
flutters from his palms.

HARRY
Excuse me, Sir, but... where's
Professor Lupin?

SNAPE
That's not really your concern, is
it, Potter? Suffice it to Say,
your Professor finds himself
incapable of teaching at the
present time. Page 394.

Snape waves the MOTH away, blows out a candle and a SLIDE
SHOW BEGINS. An ANCIENT WOODCUT of a HORRIFIC BEAST
flickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at
his book.

RON
Werewolves?

HERMIONE
But, sir, we've only just begun
learning about Red Caps and
Hinkypunks. We're not meant to
start nocturnal beasts for

weeks -SNAPE
Quiet!
RON
(to Harry)

When did she come in? Did you see
her come in...

SNAPE
Now. Which of you can tell me the
difference between an Animagus and
a werewolf?

As the class stares mutely at a SLIDE of an ATTACKING
WEREWOLF, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to
respond to Snape's guestion, the moth flutters by Harry.

SWAT! He pins it to his desk. A tiny cloud of moth dust
mushrooms into the air and Harry lifts his palm.
Malfoy's PARCHMENT has reappeared.

SNAPE
No one? How... disappointing.

HERMIONE
Please, Sir, an Animagus iS a wizard who elects to turn
into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter.
Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
responds only to the call of its own kind -Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.

SNAPE
Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must
admit to feeling your pain. That
is the second time you have spoken
out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell
me. Are you incapable of
restraining yourself? Or do you
take pride in being an
insufferable know-it-all?

RON
(to Harry)
He's got a point, you know.

Harry stares at the parchment. Malfoy has drawn a crude
caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING over and over.

SNAPE

Five points from Gryffindor!

(to the class)
As a antidote to your ignorance, I
prescribe two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf by Monday morning,
With particular emphasis placed on
recognizing it.

(suddenly)
Passing notes, Potter?

Snape SNATCHES the drawing from under Harry's nose. Eyes
it.

SNAPE
Not exactly Picasso, are you? I
hope you demonstrate more talent
on the Quidditch pitch this
weekend then you do as an artist.

clouds bloom with ICY BLUE light. Far below, in the
stands, RAIN lashes the SEA OF UMBRELLAS. As one flies
free, soaring end over end into the sky, the...

...« CROWD EXPLODES and two Quidditch squads -- Gryffindor
in SCARLET, Hufflepuff in CANARY-YELLOW -- shoot into the
air. Twin BLUDGERS FIRE skyward, and the match is on.

We CUT INTO Harry, rising like a rocket through the mist,
his robes SNAPPING VIOLENTLY in the wind.

INTERCUT HARRY'S POV

-- as he flies, RAIN falling like NEEDLES before him,
every dark cloud concealing potential danger. Beaters
crisscross his path. A BLUDGER WHIZZES past, then a
second ROCKETS DIRECTLY AT HIM.

SWOOP! -- Harry ducks, watches the BLUDGER SHATTER the
BROOM of a HUFFLEPUFF BEATER. The Beater goes into a
wild spiral, vanishes in the mist.

IN THE STANDS

Ron squints upward, the players little more than
STREAKING BLURS from his vantage. KA-SSSST! A STITCH OF
LIGHTNING strikes the TAIL of ANGELINA JOHNSON'S broom.
As it BURSTS into FLAMES, she PLUMMETS to the pitch. Ron
looks down at his own HAND. In the HIGHLY-CHARGED AIR,
the HAIR above his knuckles RISES.

In the sky, Harry flies fearlessly, searching for the
Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and
CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF VIEW far below. Suddenly, in
the stands opposite, a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand
of a RAVENCLAW GIRL. For a moment, it sails wondrously
through the heavy air, a Magritte dream, then -- WHOOP!
WHOOP! WHOOP! -- abruptly picks up speed, ROTATING LIKE
A HATCHET. Harry DUCKS, turns, and watches it disappear
into a bank of clouds. Then...

-.. something GLIMMERS: the Snitch. Instantly, Harry
jets off closing fast on the tiny, glimmering ball,

chasing it through one cloud... then another... and
another... until...
...- he BREAKS into a clear patch of sky... only to find

the Snitch is gone. Angrily, Harry whips the Nimbus back
around, searching the horizon frantically, when he spies
something:

In the stadium's HIGHEST TOWER, something ENORMOUS
flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE, then is obscured by a
veil of mist.

Harry turns. In the distance, the stray umbrella spins
INTO VIEW, harpoons a player. Harry's eyes shift. The
SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of

a cloud. Harry begins to go... when the veil of mist
shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief
moment -- a GREAT DOG is revealed. As this mist closes,

Harry frowns, jets away.

As Harry pelts after the Snitch, the crowd RISES TO THEIR
FEET, ROARING. Ron GRINS over the binoculars, watching
Harry shred the mist as he urges his broom on.

HARRY
Come on! Faster!

The trace of a smile forms on Harry's lips as he closes
on the Snitch... only yards away... reaching out...
when...

them, then flinches: BLOOD trickles down his cheek. The
rain is turning to needles. Needles of ice. Harry
glances at the HANDLE of his BROOMSTICK. The water
sluicing through the grain is FREEZING. VAPOR streams
from his mouth and nose.

SWOOSH! A dark SILHOUETTE passes on his right. He
turns. SWOOSH! -- a twin SILHOUETTE passes on his left.
Harry sees neither. Looks down. The layers of mist are
parting below. LIGHTNING STRIKES. Reveals: an ARMY OF
SILHOUETTES drifting onto the pitch. A vast legion of
them...

DEMENTORS.

A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND, rises in pitch,
not a whistle at all, but a... SCREAM. A WOMAN'S SCREAM.
Harry's eyes flutter, and wisps of SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
float from his mouth. His glasses glaze over completely.
His fingers, rigid, can no longer grip the broom and...

He FALLS.

HERMIONE
Noll!

Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions.

The Nimbus soars end over end, tossed by the currents,
then drops... right into the Whomping Willow.

FLOOMPH! Harry, in freefall, drops through one cloud,
then another. Plummeting through the circling Dementors.

Then... a TALL FIGURE rises from the crowd. Raises an
OPEN HAND to the heavens. Eyes angry but clear.
Dumbledore.

An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the
air.

A FLASH -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky.
And then...

lake's edge.

HARRY
Why do they affect me so,
Professor? I mean, more than
everyone else...

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors are among the foulest
creatures that walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory, until a person
is left with nothing but his worst
experiences. You're not weak,
Harry. The Dementors affect you
most, because there are true
horrors in your past. Horrors
your classmates can scarcely

eying the mist...

DRACO
Wait a minute, there's something
out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!

Malfoy's SKI MASK is pulled over his eyes, he's spun
about, given a ROUGH KICK to the ass and sent stumbling
over the rise and out of sight. Instantly, Crabbe and
Goyle join him.

Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance,
and... DASH OFF... when -- FLUMPH! -- they both go
flying, land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up,
they hear...

LAUGHTER. Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion.

ease -- rips it clean off the fittings. Fudge joins
McGonagall and a CURVY BARMAID (ROSMERTA) outside the
THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB.

HERMIONE
That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron
fancies her.

RON
It's not true!

HARRY
Shhh.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
I trust business is good?

MADAM ROSMERTA
It'd be a right sight better if
the Ministry wasn't sending
Dementors into my pub every other

briefly past a frosted window, then... THREE SHRUNKEN
HEADS swing INTO VIEW.

SHRUNKEN HEAD #1
So I says to him, ‘Careful, Ned.
Don't want to go losing your head! '

As the three heads CACKLE HYSTERICALLY, bobbing up and

down on their strings, Harry turns... just as an UNSHAVEN
WIZARD'S arm whips down and a DART goes WHISTLING right
toward Harry's eyes. Harry DUCKS, pivots, and -- THWOCK!

-- sees the dart pierce the cork of the disfigured
DARTBOARD behind him.

Harry hurries on, trailing Fudge and McGonagall up a DARK

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Years ago, when Harry Potter's
parents were marked for death,
they went into hiding. Few knew
where they were. One who did was
black. And he told...

MADAM ROSMERTA
You-Know-Who. I've heard this
rot. It was all over The Daily
Prophet back in the day. And I'll
Say now what I said then: Of all
the boys I ran out of here,
Black's the last who would've gone
over to the dark side. Hearsay.
That's all the Ministry had.
Hearsay.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!

MADAM ROSMERTA
Peter Pettigrew?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Little lump of a boy? Always
tagging after Black and...

MADAM ROSMERTA
I remember him. What's he got to
do with it?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
After the Potters were killed,
Pettigrew went looking for Black.
And, unfortunately... found him.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
Black was vicious. He didn't kill
Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A
finger. That's all that was left.
A finger -- there's your hearsay.

Rosmerta looks to McGonagall. She nods grimly.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sirius Black may not have put his
hands to the Potters, but he's the
reason they're dead. And now he
wants to finish what he started.

against a lamppost: "Have you seen this wizard?"

At the end of a ROCKY OUTCROP, the FOOTPRINTS end and
SOBS are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm, discouraging
her from going further, but she does, filling the
footprints with her own, then kneeling and -- very gently
-- drawing the cloak from Harry. He stares into the
mist, eyes stinging with tears.

HARRY

He was their friend. And he
betrayed them. He was their

paces before a LARGE TRUNK.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic. Well
beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.

HARRY
If Black can fight the Dementors,
I need to know how too.

Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. The spell I'm going to
teach you is called the Patronus
Charm. Ever hear of it?

Harry shakes his head.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Patronus is a kind of positive
force. For the wizard who can
conjure one, the Patronus works
something like a shield. The
Dementor feeds on it instead of
him.

Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eyes
wander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attention

back.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
But in order for it to work, you
must think of a memory. And not
just any. This memory needs to be
a very happy one. And powerful.

Harry thinks a bit. Then... nods.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Got something? Good. Let it fill
you up. Lose yourself in it.
Then speak the incantation:
Expecto Patronum. Without your
wand...

As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES. In
the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly
horrific.

HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...

The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL BREEZE fills
the chamber. A SCREAM ECHOES distantly. Harry's hand
trembles. His eyes begin to roll up...

HARRY
Expecto... Expecto...

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!

Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into the
packing case. Harry stands blinking. Dazed. Lupin
fishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket. Presses it into
Harry's trembling hand.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quickly.

Harry studies the frog. Takes a bite. Begins to
recover.

HARRY
That's one nasty Dementor.

There's another. It's not happy
exactly. I mean, it is. It's the
happiest I've ever felt. But
it's... complicated.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Is it strong?

Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes. Emotional. Nods.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Then let's try it.

Harry takes a breath. Tosses the frog aside. Poises
himself.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Think, Harry, think -
HARRY
Just do it!

Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens the
packing case. Instantly, the Dementor appears again. A
chill fills the air. The hair skates off Harry's scar.
He sets his jaw...

HARRY
Expecto Patronum!

Harry's hand TREMBLES. His whole BODY TREMBLES. But he

holds his ground, when -- WHOOSH! -- a huge SILVER SHADOW
BURSTS from the end of his wand, hovering between him and
the Dementor. The Dementor falters... Harry's legs like
water...

Saying something.

Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself.

HARRY
I was thinking of him. And Mum.
Seeing their faces. They're just

Cadogan who, sensing the attention, perks up instantly.

you let a mysterious man enter
Gryffindor Tower tonight?

SIR CADOGAN

Harry squints toward the end of the corridor. Down at
the map. Pettigrew moves guickly down the adjoining

corridor. Twenty yards away. Ten. Only seconds away...

Wand trembling in his hand, Harry glances from the map to

the dark corridor ahead, again and again. Then... as the
two DOTS are about to collide... he looks slowly up...
turns the corner... heart in his chest... and meets...
HIMSELF

glances back down at the map. Pettigrew has moved past
him. Confused, Harry wheels, casts his wand along the
walls.

Harry JUMPS. But it's only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING,
scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. On the map,
"Pettigrew’ continues to move away. Harry makes to
follow, then stops. HEARS FOOTSTEPS. The WAND'S SPOT
dances across the parchment, finds another DOT.
Approaching FAST: "Severus Snape.”

Mischief managed!

Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and
turns... into the harsh glare of Snape's wand.

Snape eyes Harry coldly. Containing himself. Lowers his

That remains to be seen. I've

Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather
unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions.

SNAPE
Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I seriously doubt that, Severus.
It looks to me as if it merely

Sirius Black -- is a map to you?

Harry walks silently. Lupin can barely contain his anger.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father didn't set much store
by rules either. But he and your
mother did give their lives to
save yours. Gambling their
sacrifice by walking about the
castle unprotected, with a killer
on the loose, strikes me as a poor
way to repay them. I won't cover
up for you again, Harry.

Lupin enters his office, tosses the map on his desk, and

begins to

sort through some papers. Harry lingers

briefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOON
that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn
away. Stops.

HARRY
Professor. Just so you know, I
don't think the map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the
castle. Someone I know to be dead.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Peter Pettigrew.

Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his

papers.

My dear, from the moment you first

you did not possess the proper
Spirit for the noble art of
Divination. You may be young in
years, but the heart that beats
beneath your bosom is as shriveled
as an old maid's, your soul as dry
as the pages of the books to which
you so desperately cleave.

she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry
watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the

Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts

a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and...

finds...

Harry stiffens. Trelawney's voice is eerily HOLLOW.

HARRY

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Tonight, when the clock strikes
twelve, the servant shall break
free. He and his Master shall be

Trelawney smiles savagely... then her head falls forward.

Harry -- clearly unsettled by his encounter with
Trelawney -- hastens down the stairs, and we...
FADE OUT.
INT. CLOCKTOWER COURTYARD —- DAY (LATER) 104

SWOOK! SWOOK! We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as
it glides to the flock circling the feet of a POT-BELLIED
MAN (THE EXECUTIONER) sitting in the courtyard. As he
sharpens his AXE -- SWOOK! SWOOK! -- we -
CUT TO:

HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE
hurrying past. The Executioner looks up and we -
CUT TO:

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 105
... Harry, leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut.

HERMIONE
I can't believe they're going to
kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.

HARRY
It just got worse.

She and Ron look and SEE:

EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION —- LATE 106
AFTERNOON

Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a
grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand,
Spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch,
tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Hagrid wipes his eyes,
lopes into the hut.

DRACO
Did you see the big, fat
blubbering oaf?! Oh, this is
going to be rich. Did I tell you,
Father said I can keep the head -(looking up)
Ah. Come to see the show?

HERMIONE
You... foul... loathsome...
evil... little cockroach...

Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear
as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose,
when...

RON
Hermione! No!

She turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. He looks away.

RON
He's not worth it.

Hermione nods, then -- SMACK! -- guick as lightning,
lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat
on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs,
Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind.

HERMIONE
That felt good.

EXT. SLOPE/PUMPKIN PATCH - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 107
LATER)

The trio makes their way down the slope and past
Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction.

INT. HAGRID'S HUT - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK) 108

Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and
Ron sit. Hermione makes tea.

HAGRID
Look at ‘em. Loves the smell

o' the trees when the wind
blows...

HARRY
I say we set him free.

HAGRID

(shaking his head)
They'd know I did it. And tha'
would only get Dumbledore in
trouble. Gonna come down, yeh
know. Says he wants ter be with
me when it... when it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.

We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.

HAGRID
Yeh will not! Think I wan' yeh

Yeh'1ll drink yer tea an' be off.

But before yeh do -- I wan' ter
see you an' Ron shake hands,
Harry.

Ron and Harry exchange a glance, then look to Hagrid.

HAGRID
Thin' I haven' seen ‘ow it's bin
betw'n you two? Go on now...

Reluctantly, Harry and Ron extend their hands. Shake.

HAGRID
Good. Now then. Ron, I wan' ter
see you give Hermione a hug.

HERMIONE/RON
What!

HAGRID
Go on! You two've been at it all
year. An' I'm sick o' it.

Acutely uncomfortable, Hermione and Ron step forward and
perform perhaps the most awkward hug Hogwarts has ever

HAGRID
Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most
pathetic hug I e'er seen. But yeh
did it, an' tha's wha' matters.
There's jus' one other thing...

RON
I'm not kissing Fang if that's
what you're thinking...

Hearing his name, FANG -- Hagrid's giant boarhound -THUMPS his tail happily on the floor. Hagrid turns,
takes the lid from a FLOUR TIN, A TINY HEAD, ears flecked
with powder, emerges.

RON
Scabbers! You're alive!

RON

Right. Next time I see
Crookshanks, I'll let him know.

HERMIONE
I meant me.

HAGRID
Crikey. Here we go agin...

SMASH! A GLASS JAR on the SHELF SHATTERS. As Hermione
scoops up a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE, a second STONE
bounces off the back of Harry's head.

HARRY
Ow!

Harry turns, looks out the window.

HARRY
Hagrid...

Everyone turns. Looks. Dumbledore and Fudge approach.
Behind them, in a fluttering shroud of CROWS, the
Executioner follows, axe at his side. Hagrid begins to
panic.

HAGRID
Yeh got to go! It's almost dark.
Anyone sees yeh outside the castle
it'll be trouble! Big trouble!
‘Specially you, Harry -
BANG! BANG! BANG! The door SHAKES. Hagrid stiffens in
fear. Harry reaches up, puts his finger to Hagrid's
trembling lips, speaks softly to the others.
HARRY
C'mon.

EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - PUMPKIN PATCH - WIDE SHOT - DUSK 109

A veil of crows flutters onto the roof. More drop into
the patch, begin to slowly circle Buckbeak.

Harry and the others duck behind the pumpkins, watch
Hagrid solemnly greet the others. Fudge appears at the
window. Picks his nose. Just then, a Shhh! is heard.
Hermione turns. The branches of the trees behind her are
DANCING ODDLY.

HARRY
What?

HERMIONE
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.

EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 110

The trio slip silently into a stand of trees. Beyond
them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun.
High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.

DING!

DING!

DING!

The trio stops, fighting their tears. A QUARTET OF BLEAK
SHADOWS files from the hut. One of the SHADOWS -Dumbledore -- raises his hand and points, directing the
attention of the others away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore
speaks briefly -- unintelligible from this distance,
then -- CAW! CAW! -- The crows SHRIEK excitedly and the
Executioner separates from the others, disappears behind
a LOW STAND OF TREES.

DING!

All goes very still. The wind loses its voice...

DING!

Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees,
INTO VIEW...

DING!

The ax hangs seemingly forever, etched against the sky,
then drops from sight. A SICKENING CHOP! fouls the
breeze and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb
disbelief. Hermione, face turned away, trembles...

DING!
The SUN sets, dropping behind the mountains in the
distance. Hermione turns. Sees a frenzied spray of
crows stain the bloody sky, their PRIMAL SHRIEKING rising
like a curse.
Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder and
CAMERA FALLS WITH her, CONTINUING DOWN the length of
Ron's arm to his hand, where a DROP OF BLOOD hangs from
his finger, drops like a tear...
DING!

Ron stares at his hand. At the blood running down his
finger.

RON
He bit me...

His eyes shift. See Scabbers streaking away.

HERMIONE
Ron! No!

As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give
chase.
EXT. RIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110A
Ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top.
Hermione and Harry follow.
EXT. WHOMPING WILLOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110B
Harry and Hermione reach the top of the ridge. Stop.
HERMIONE

Ron nabs Scabbers, cradles him in his bloody palm.

Willow.

Ron! Run!

Ron spins. Looks toward Harry.

RON
Harry! Run!

Harry's eyes shift. Bounding toward him in the gathering

gloom is an ENORMOUS, PALE-EYED, JET-BLACK... DOG. Harry
shields himself when... the dog LEAPS CLEAR OVER HIM.
RON
Aaaahhh!
The dog's TEETH flash and -- SNAP! -- close on Ron's

foot, dragging him TOWARDS THE TRUNK like a rag doll.
Instantly, Harry dashes forward, leaps out, and grabs
Ron's hands... but he and Ron just keep skudding along
the ground.

HERMIONE
I've got you -
Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the
three of them go scudding along.

RON
Harry!

Harry raises his chin. The dog vanishes into the GAP at
the base of the tree, begins to pull Ron through...

HARRY
Hold on, Ron!

But it's no use. The dog is too powerful. Harry glances
around desperately, then finds himself looking directly
in Ron's eyes. He can read his mind.

HARRY
No, Ron...

One by one, Ron releases his fingers from Harry's
forearm. Sacrificing himself.

HARRY
Nooooo! !!

But Ron closes his eyes, releases his hands fully, and...

Disappears. As his VOICE ECHOES deep into the earth...
Harry and Hermione rise, peer into the hole.

WHOMP! The Whomping Willow sweeps first Hermione, then
Harry, into the air and -- FLOOMPH -- drops them on their
backsides.

HARRY AND HERMIONE'S POV - THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD

Swaying beautifully against the dusky sky, swishing
softly.

BACK TO SCENE

As one, they rise. Run back toward the gap in the tree.
A branch swoops down.

Hermione ducks. Harry doesn't. WHOOSH -- he is flung
one way, his GLASSES the other.

Hermione HOPS over another branch -- looks briefly
pleased with herself -- only to find herself SWEPT HIGH
IN THE AIR by a second branch. She looks down, sees
Harry searching the ground for his glasses.

HERMIONE

Harry squints up, sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST of a branch
screaming straight down for his head. He rolls away just
as -- WHOMP! -- the branch PULVERIZES the ground.

Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME, still clinging on for dear
life, and Harry rises. FLUMPH! -- he's promptly knocked
to the ground again. Hermione goes CRASHING through the
high branches, Harry spies his glasses and grabs them.
Rising, he fits them to his face and...

HIS BLURRY POV...

-.. turns CRYSTAL CLEAR just in time to see Hermione
FLYING MADLY TOWARD HIM.

HERMIONE
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhbhh!

HARRY
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Hermione reaches out, grabs Harry's shirt and -- riding

the branch in tandem -- the two boomerang back, hurtling
toward the trunk of the tree, through the gap, and into

the darkness...

HERMIONE
Thanks.

HARRY
Don't mention it. JLumos.

As the tip of Harry's WAND GLOWS, reveals a long, snaking
tunnel.

HERMIONE
Where do you suppose this goes?

HARRY
I have a hunch. I just hope I'm
wrong...
INT. TUNNEL TO SHRIEKING SHACK - NIGHT 111A

Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive
passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead.

Then, abruptly, the tunnel... ends. Confused, Harry and
Hermione glance about, then -- as one -- peer up. A
small opening. Harry reaches up, hoists himself through.

INT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DECREPIT ROOM —- NIGHT 112

Harry pulls Hermione up. Looks about. Paper peels from
the walls. Stains -- suspiciously similar to dried blood
-- blot the floorboards. Shattered furniture lies strewn
everywhere.

HERMIONE
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

Harry doesn't answer, Staring at the DOG PRINTS in the DUST
on the floor. The CEILING CREAKS. They dash to the stairs.
INT. HALLWAY - LANDING - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 113
They come out, look down. A wide, shiny stripe cuts

through the DUST-LADEN floor -- as if something has been
dragged -- to the end of the hallway, where a LIGHT seeps

from a door.

HARRY
NOX.

His wand-light dies. Slowly, they step to the door.

Exchange a look. She nods, wand ready, and Harry KICKS
the door aside.

INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME 114
Ron sits upon a sagging bed, clutching his bloody foot.

HERMIONE
Ron! You're okay -
HARRY
The dog -- where's the -
RON
It's a trap, Harry. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus...

Harry looks down, follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to
a pair of FILTHY HUMAN FEET. Harry looks up slowly at
the MAN standing in the shadows. Filthy, matted hair
hangs to his shoulders. His skin like a corpse.

SIRIUS BLACK.

He studies Harry's face keenly. Harry draws his wand.

HERMIONE
If you want to kill Harry, you'll
-- you'll... have to kill us, too!

SIRIUS BLACK
No. Only one will die tonight.

HARRY
Then it'll be you!

HERMIONE
Harry! No!

Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound. Black wheels toward the
door, edgy. Harry eyes Black, wand hand shaking
violently. As Black turns back, he stops, regards Harry
cautiously.

SIRIUS BLACK
Going to kill me, Harry?

HARRY
Yes.

Harry raises his wand. BLAM! -- the DOOR CRASHES OPEN:
Lupin.

HARRY /HERMIONE/RON

Professor Lupin!
Lupin ignores them, eying Black intensely.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Looking a bit ragged, aren't we,
Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
the madness within.

SIRIUS BLACK
You'd know all about the madness
within, wouldn't you, Remus?

The two regard each other, the moment taut with tension,
then Lupin steps forward and... EMBRACES Black like a
brother.

HERMIONE
No! I trusted you! I covered up
for you. And all this time you've
been his friend!
(pointing)
He's a werewolf! That's why he's
been missing classes!

Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin. Black HOWLS
then, bitterly amused. Lupin eyes him, then turns back.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
How long have you known?

HERMIONE
Since Professor Snape set the
essay.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're the brightest witch of your
age I've ever met, Hermione.

SIRIUS BLACK
Yes, you glow like the sun. And
you howl at the moon. Enough
talk! He dies. Now. If you
won't do it with me, Remus, I'll
do it alone.

wouldn't have lasted a week!

Lupin eyes Black, then nods.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
All right then. As you wish...

HARRY
No!

Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and, with a flick
of his own, disarms him. Furious, Harry eyes Black
murderously.

HARRY
You betrayed my parents! You sold
them to Voldemort!

SIRIUS BLACK
It's a lie! I never would've
betrayed James and Lily!

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry! You've got to listen -
HARRY
Did he listen! When my mother was
dying! Did he hear her screaming!

SIRIUS BLACK
No! I wasn't there! And I'll
regret it the rest of my life!

Harry's eyes flash to Black's, glittering with pain.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Someone else betrayed your
parents, Harry. Someone in this
room right now. Someone who,
until guite recently, I believed
to be dead.

SIRIUS BLACK
He's as good as dead.

HARRY
What're you talking about?
There's nobody here.

SIRIUS BLACK
Oh yes there is...

Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a cruel Sing
song:

SIRIUS BLACK
Come out, come out, Peter
Come out, come out and play...

Ron draws back from Black's demented gaze.

RON
You're mad...

Harry's eyes shift from Ron's FACE to his HANDS, where
Scabbers TWISTS violently. As a curious expression
befalls Harry, Lupin and Black, as one, raise their
wands... when.

SNAPE
Expelliarmus!

The wands fly from their hands. The others turn, find
Snape standing in the doorway, smiling smugly.

SNAPE
(eying Black)
Ah, vengeance iS sweet. How I
hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Severus -
SNAPE
I told Dumbledore you were helping
your old friend into the castle.
And here's the proof.

SIRIUS BLACK
Brilliant! And -- as usual -dead wrong. Now give us our wands
back. Remus and I have a bit of
unfinished business to tend to.

As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck.

SNAPE
Give me a reason. I beg you.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Don't be a fool, Severus!

Quiet, Sirius!

SNAPE
(clucking his tongue)
Listen to you two. Quarreling
like an old married couple. The
creature and the criminal.

SIRIUS BLACK

Piss off.

SNAPE
Witty as ever I see. Tell me,
will you be so irreverent when I
turn you over to the Dementors?

(as Black reacts)

Do I detect a flicker of fear?
One can only imagine what it must
be like to endure the Dementor's
Kiss. It's said to be unbearable
to witness. But I'll do my best.

Snape's eyes harden. He gestures to the door.

SNAPE
After you.

As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table
where Lupin has left Harry's wand. Ina flash, it's in
his hand.

HARRY
Expelliarmus!

Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a THUD, and
slides down. Ron and Hermione stare in shock.

HERMIONE
Harry. You attacked a teacher.

Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.

HARRY
You said Peter before. Peter who?

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Pettigrew. He was at school with
us. We thought he was a friend.

No. Pettigrew's dead. dHe killed
him.

As Harry points at Black, Black laughs mirthlessly.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I thought so, too. Until you
mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the
Map e

HARRY
The Map was lying then -
SIRIUS BLACK
The Map never lies. Pettigrew's
alive. And he's right there.

Black points at... Ron. Ron goes white with fear.

RON
M-me? It's lunatic...

SIRIUS BLACK
Not you, you idiot. Your rat.

RON
Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my
family for -
SIRIUS BLACK
(bitterly)
Twelve years. A curiously long
life for a common garden rat.
He's missing a toe, isn't he?

Black unfolds a dog-eared clipping from The Daily
Prophet: it shows Ron in Egypt with his family, Scabbers
on his shoulder.

RON
So what?

HARRY
All they could find of Pettigrew
was his -
SIRIUS BLACK
Finger. Dirty coward cut it off

Harry stares into Black's sunken eyes. Wanting to

agonized face. Scabbers SQUIRMS VIOLENTLY.

HARRY
Show me.

Lupin and Black turn to Ron. He holds Scabbers
protectively.

RON
What are you going to do to him?

Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.

SIRIUS BLACK
Together.

With that, Lupin takes out his wand and, as one, he and
Black cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. Scabbers twists
madly in midair, then -- FLASH! -- transforms into... a
very short man with thinning hair and grubby hands.

PETER PETTIGREW.

PETTIGREW
S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old
friends.

Neither speaks. Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart
toward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes a
break for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back.
Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry. His
hands flutter nervously, reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER.

PETTIGREW
Harry! Look at you! Y-you look
just like your father. Like
James. We were the best of
friends, he and I -
SIRIUS BLACK
Shut up!

Ron! Haven't I been a good

Ron draws back in disgust. Pettigrew turns to Hermione.

PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...

As one, Lupin and Black raise their wands, point them
directly into Pettigrew's face. He shrinks back
trembling, closing his eyes in fear, when...

HARRY
No.

Pettigrew's lids lift. Lupin and Black turn. Staggered.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry, this man...

HARRY
I know what he is. But we'll take

Get off! I said we'd take you to

As Pettigrew emerges from the gap, he prattles
desperately:

PETTIGREW

Turn me into a maggot. A dung
beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything
but the Dementors...

(as Ron emerges )
Ron! Haven't I been a good
friend? A good pet? You won't
let them kill me, will you? I was
your rat...

As Ron draws back in disgust, a sleepwalking Snape BUMPS
his head against a low limb. Hermione turns to Harry.

HERMIONE
Don't worry. He's under the
Somnambulist Charm. It's
primarily used to transport the
seriously deranged.

As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.

PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...

Hermione tugs her robes from Pettigrew's sweaty grasp.
Harry turns, sees Black staring in wonder at the castle,
shining radiantly under the bright bowl of the night sky.

SIRIUS BLACK

Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never
forget the first time I walked
through those doors. It'll be
nice to do it again. Freely.

(turning to Harry)
That was a noble thing you did
back there. He doesn't deserve
it.

Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, looks away. Lost in
thought.

HARRY
I don't reckon my father'd want
his best friends to become killers
for a worthless piece of vermin
like Pettigrew. Besides: Dead,
the truth dies with him. Alive...
you're free.

SIRIUS BLACK

HARRY
I know.

SIRIUS BLACK
And, well, I'll understand if you
choose to stay with your aunt and
uncle, but, so you know, you
could -
HARRY
Come live with you? When!

SIRIUS BLACK
Soon as my name's cleared...

Harry looks at Hogwarts. GRINS. Sirius does the same.
Then, Hermione's voice rises on the air, quavering with
fear.

HERMIONE
Harry...

He turns, see Hermione staring at the FULL MOON. His
eyes shift. Lupin is a rigid silhouette, his fingers
twitching.

SIRIUS BLACK
Remus, Old friend... did you take
your potion tonight?

Lupin, twitching, SHAKES HIS HEAD. Pettigrew's eyes
dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift, note
the WAND trembling in LUPIN'S LENGTHENING FIST.

SIRIUS BLACK
Run. All of you. Now.

But none of them do, transfixed, watching as BRISTLES
POKE THROUGH LUPIN'S SKIN. Black steps forward, wraps
his arms around his friend, presses his mouth to his ear.

SIRIUS BLACK
You know the man you truly are,
Remus. This flesh is only flesh.

No!

Expelliarmus!

Lupin's wand flies from Pettigrew's hand and he FREEZES.
Then slowly turns. Face blank, eyes closed, he... GRINS
HIDEOUSLY. Transforms. Stunned, Harry watches a RAT
dart into the night.

A HOWL PIERCES THE AIR and Harry wheels. With a shrug,
Lupin tosses Black into the air, then turns. He is no
longer human. He's a werewolf. Harry and Hermione begin
to edge back.

HERMIONE
Professor...?

The WEREWOLF'S eyes blaze. Long teeth glitter. Then...
a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat. Harry and
Hermione spin, begin to flee... and run flat into Snape.
As they collapse in a great clumsy pile, Snape's eyes
flutter open, the spell broken. Seeing Hermione atop
him, he sweeps her aside...

SNAPE
Out of the way!

-.. and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
to his feet, Snape draws his wand and steps forward,
shielding Hermione, Harry and Ron.

The WEREWOLF HOWLS, SPRINTS forward, when -- SWOOSH! -- a
GIANT DOG (Black) intercepts it in MIDAIR. They hit the
ground in a FIERCE TANGLE of FLASHING TEETH, a single
horrible flailing beast. Again and again, the dog pushes
the werewolf back, but the werewolf is too strong...

HARRY
Sirius!

The DOG YELPS, ROARS in pain, and the werewolf flings it
into the tall grass. As it charges after, Harry pushes
past Snape, dashes into the night. Hermione makes to
follow, but Snape holds her back.

Desperately, Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground
and hurls it with all his might. Bull's-eye. The
werewolf freezes. Turns. Begins to move toward...
Harry.

Harry draws his wand, terrified, but tormented as well,
knowing Lupin dwells somewhere within the beast.

HARRY
Please, Professor. Stop... It's

Suddenly... a HOWL pierces the night.

The werewolf falters, cocking its head toward the forest.
Harry waits, petrified. The WEREWOLF's eyes shift back
to him. It SNARLS, moves closer, ready to kill. Harry
covers his face with his arm, when...

-.-.- a SECOND HOWL ECHOES high above the forest. Slowly,
Harry drops his arm. Looks. The werewolf bounds toward
the forest, vanishes. Harry's eyes shift. In the
darkness, the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass.
Falls. Rises. Falls again. Each time becoming more
human. As he diSappears over the ridge, Harry sprints
after.

EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 117A
Harry stumbles down to Black, who lies on the water's
edge, now fully a man, arms and face gleaming with

lacerations.

HARRY
Sirius!

Harry looks into his glassy eyes.

HARRY

A fragile MIST escapes Harry's mouth. A raw WIND TOSSES
his hair. CHILL-BUMPS pebble his SKIN. A FRINGE of ICE
appears at the lake's edge. Then they appear, oozing

like smoke through the TREES across the lake. Dementors.

HARRY
No... No!
(drawing his wand)
Expecto... Patronum!

A thin silvery wisp weeps from Harry's wand, hovering
like a VEIL, but the Dementors continue to come. Harry
places his hand on Black's HEAVING HEART, poises his wand
once more:

HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...

Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies. Harry's
eyes flutter, the DEMENTORS twisting madly in his vision,
drawing closer. Black GASPS. SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT
tumble from his lips, as if his very soul were leaving
him...

Then... a LIGHT splinters the trees. Harry sgquints, sees
a FIERY STAG appear... its body luminous... slashing
through the trees... sowing light in the darkness. The

Dementors wilt in its wake, but more replace them,
sweeping down in waves. Still, the stag charges on. The
LIGHT EXPANDS. The forest blazing with it. The remaining
Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash.

The light ebbs. The stag's luminous body flickers.
There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single
THREAD of LIGHT all that remains, Spinning down to the

size of a PEARL... in the palm of MAN, standing deep in
the trees. Harry studies the strangely familiar
SILHOUETTE, then... it is gone.

Silence drops like a curtain. MIST rises from the lake.
As Snape appears at the top of the rise, we -
FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT. HOSPITAL WING —- NIGHT (LATER) 118
CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... out of HERMIONE'S SHADOW,

which ripples against the curtain that encircles Harry's

the CURTAIN ASIDE. Ron lies opposite, his leg BANDAGED.
Hermione paces. Stops.

HERMIONE
Harry -HARRY
I saw my dad.
HERMIONE
What...?
HARRY
He sent the Dementors away... I

saw him. Across the lake...

Hermione exchanges a private glance with Ron, turns back.

HERMIONE
Listen, Harry. They've captured
Sirius. Any minute the Dementors
are going to perform the Kiss.

HARRY
The Kiss...?

HERMIONE
It's what Dementors do to those
they want to destroy. They clamp
their jaws over the victim's mouth
and... suck out his soul.

HARRY
You mean, they're going to kill
Sirius?

HERMIONE
No. It's worse. Much worse. You
go on living. But you have no
memory. No sense of self. You're
just a shall. An empty shell...

As Harry reacts, the door opens and Dumbledore enters.

HERMIONE
Headmaster! You've got to stop
them! They've got the wrong man!

HARRY
It's true, Sir. Sirius is
innocent -
RON
It's Scabbers who did it!

Percy's -
HERMIONE
The point is... we know the truth.
Please, Sir, you must believe us.

DUMBLEDORE
I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry
to say the word of three thirteenyear-old wizards will convince few
others. A child's voice, however
honest and true, iS meaningless to
those who have forgotten how to
listen.

As Dumbledore turns to the window, a SHOOTING STAR
plummets silently through the sky.

DUMBLEDORE
Ah... a Shooting star. If ever
one was to make a wish, now would
be the time. But time, I'm
afraid, is precisely our
problem...

On cue, the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME... DING!...

DING!

DUMBLEDORE
Mysterious thing, time. Powerful.
And, when meddled with...
dangerous. Sirius Black is in the
topmost cell of the Dark Tower.

(to Hermione)

You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen. And you
would, I feel, do well to return
before this last chime. If not...
well, the consequences are really
too ghastly to discuss. Three
turns should do it, I think. If
you succeed, more than one
innocent life may be spared
tonight.

He smiles, exits. Harry glances curiously at the
chocolate.

RON
What in bloody hell was all that
about?

But Hermione doesn’t reply, instead looping the pendant's
long chain around Harry's neck as well as her own.

HERMIONE
Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you
can't walk...

As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the BELL

continues to CHIME -- DING! DING! -- and...

TIME REVERSES in a dizzying backward blur, as if a tape
were being rewound, every moment that occurred in the
hospital room flickering by at a dizzying speed while,
outside the window, darkness gives way to dusk and the
sun "un-sets,'" returning to its place low on the horizon.
At this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is...

Empty. Except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione
unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion.

HARRY
What just happened? Where's Ron?

Hermione ignores the question, eyes the CLOCK on the
wall.

Harry and Hermione come to a mad, huffing halt.

HARRY
Hermione! Will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?!

She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry
follows her gaze and BLINKS in DISBELIEF. Across the
grounds...

EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN —- SAME TIME —- LATE AFTERNOON 124

to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths.

HARRY
But that... that's... us. This is
not... normal.

INTERCUT BETWEEN BRIDGE AND SUNDIAL GARDEN.
Dumbfounded, Harry turns. Hermione holds up the HOURGLASS.

HERMIONE
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first
term. This is how I've been
getting to my lessons all year.

HARRY
You mean, we've gone back in time?

HARRY

Good punch.
HERMIONE

Hurry! Malfoy's coming!

Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later,
FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads.

DRACO (0.S.)

Not a word of this to anyone,
understood! I'll get that jumpedup Mudblood one of these days.
Mark my words...

Eyes narrowed in anger, Hermione leans out, reaches up,
and sends Malfoy SPRAWLING. As Harry pulls her back,
Malfoy looks around in confusion, then dashes off with
the others.

Seconds later, Harry emerges, marvels at the sight

of himself and Hermione, and Ron heading down the
slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin
patch.

HARRY
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

HERMIONE
Of course! Remember what
Dumbledore said. If we succeed,
more than one innocent life could
be spared.

HARRY
Buckbeak? But... how will saving
Buckbeak help Sirius?

He grins, turns, only to find Hermione analyzing the

Harry defensively.

HERMIONE
What?

HARRY
Nothing.

Harry looks toward the slope, sees Fudge and the others
approaching in a CLOUD of CROWS.

HARRY
Here they come. I better hurry.

HERMIONE
No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him. Otherwise,
he'll think Hagrid set him free!

Harry nods, then looks toward the hut. Inside, Hagrid is
handing Scabbers to Ron.

HARRY
That's Pettigrew -
As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him, speaks
fiercely.

HERMIONE
No, Harry! You can't!

HARRY
Hermione, that's the man who
betrayed my parents! You don't
expect me to just sit here...

HERMIONE

Yes! You Must!

(pointing inside)
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut
right now. If you go bursting
inside, you'll think you've gone
mad. Awful things can happen when
wizards meddle with time. We
can't be seen.

Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing
closer. She frowns, glances into the hut.

HERMIONE
Fudge is coming and... we're not
leaving... why aren't we leaving?

Just then... on the ground beside her... Hermione notices
a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE. Instantly, she grabs it,
rises, and hurls it through the OPEN WINDOW. SMASH! The
sound of a GLASS JAR SHATTERING is heard within the hut.

HARRY
Are you mad?

Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone
through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of
Harry's head.

HARRY
That hurt.

HERMIONE
Sorry.

Crows begin to drop atop the roof. Fudge's party
arrives, RAPS on the door.

HERMIONE
C'mon. Any minute now we're going
to be coming out the back door.

Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly
behind... just in time to see themselves -- along with
Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin
pile where, only seconds before, they were hiding. As
Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before,
Hermione ponders the back of her own head.

HERMIONE
Is that really what my hair looks
like from the back?

HARRY
Shhh!

Hermione sees herself turn. Ducking, she accidentally
stirs the branches, then peeks out and sees herself
staring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY. Next
she hears her own voice:

HERMIONE (0.S.)
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.

Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope.
The coast clear, they slip out of the trees.

HERMIONE

As Harry vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at
his ankles, pecking at his feet.

CORNELIUS FUDGE (0O.S.)
‘It is the decision of the
Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures that the
Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter
called the condemned, shall be
executed this day at sundown... '

As Harry approaches, Buckbeak studies him curiously, a
ferret leg dangling from his beak. Harry bows. SLURP!
The ferret leg disappears and Buckbeak returns Harry's
nod. As Harry takes Buckbeak's chain... a flint-eyed
crow PECKS his hand.

HARRY
Get away!

Harry waves the crow away, yanks hard on Buckbeat's
chain.

CORNELIUS FUDGE (0.S.)
‘The Committee's appointed
executioner shall dispatch the
condemned by means of
beheading...’

HARRY
C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on...

Buckbeak refuses to move.

CORNELIUS FUDGE (0.S.)
'As witnessed below.’ You sign
here, Hagrid. Very well,
gentlemen. Let's step outside,
shall we...

dead ferret before Buckbeak.

HERMIONE
Here, Beaky... Come and get the
nice dead ferret... yum yum...

Harry looks at her as if she's mad, but it's... working.
As Buckbeak trots after, the CAWING CROWS scatter.

DING!

Harry and Hermione lead Buckbeak away when the back door
suddenly opens. They freeze... caught... Fudge's eyes
drifting their way, when -- as before -- Dumbledore

raises his hand and directs the attention of the others
away from Buckbeak.

DUMBLEDORE
Professor Dippet had those
blackberries planted when he was
Headmaster...

Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into
the forest... just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
Let's get this over with, shall

we?
Harry and Hermione -- their view unobstructed by the LOW
STAND OF TREES this time -- watch the Executioner
approach the pumpkin patch... and stop. Quickly, the

confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger.

CORNELIUS FUDGE

But... where is it? I just saw
the beast not moments ago -Hagrid?

HAGRID
Beaky...

Hearing Hagrid's husky voice, BUCKBEAK strains at his
tether, WHIMPERS eerily. Hermione tosses him another
ferret.

How extraordinary!

HAGRID
Professor, I swear! I didn't!

DUMBLEDORE
I'm quite sure the Minister isn't
Suggesting that you had anything
to do with it, Hagrid. How could
you? You've been with us all
along.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
We should search the grounds -
DUMBLEDORE

Search the skies if you must,
Minister. In the meantime, I
wouldn't say no to a cup of tea,
Hagrid. Or... a large brandy.

(to the Executioner )
It seems your services will no
longer be required.

The Executioner lifts his blade and -- with a brutal fury
-- plunges it into the flesh of a PUMPKIN with a
SICKENING CHOP!

The CROWS SCATTER to the skies.

Look. It's Lupin.

As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence
oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick, pokes
a knot on the trunk. Instantly, the Willow calms.

HARRY
Wait until Fred and George hear
about that one.

Here comes Snape.

As Lupin disappears into the gap at the base of the tree,
Snape makes his way down the slope.

telling Dumbledore when we were
taken to the hospital. According
to him, only a really powerful
wizard could have conjured it.

It was my Dad.

Hermione looks at Harry.

HARRY
It was my Dad who conjured the
Patronus.

HERMIONE
But, Harry, your Dad's...

When we free him, I'll never have

someplace in the country. I think
he'd like that, after all those
years in Azkaban. We don't need a
big place and I can help him...

A HOWL pierces the night. Hermione glances toward the

Willow.
HERMIONE
It's happened. Lupin's
transformed.
HARRY

Which means Pettigrew is slipping
safely into the night. While we
just stand here...

A FIERCE GROWLING is heard as twin silhouettes -- the DOG
and the WEREWOLF -- bound into the tall grass. Harry
watches himself appear, hurl the stick as before. The
werewolf turns, begins to stalk...

OWWWWWWWWW! Harry wheels, sees Hermione, hands cupped to
her mouth, making a loud HOWL. He covers her mouth.

HARRY
What are you doing?

HERMIONE
Saving your life.

Harry looks back to the tall grass. The werewolf is
frozen. As before, it begins to approach Harry again.

OWWWWWWWW! This time, Harry doesn't stop her.

Because that werewolf you just

werewolf poises itself, preparing to pounce, when...

SKREEEK! The TREES shake with the fury of a HURRICANE
and Buckbeak charges into the clearing, screening Harry
and Hermione. The WEREWOLF SNARLS ANGRILY, makes to
charge. With lightning-fast reflexes, Buckbeak's claws
slash the air... only inches from the werewolf's face.
The werewolf stops, eyes glittering with rage, then...

Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone...

A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a MIST,

door. As Harry and Hermione enter.

INT. HOSPITAL WING —- NIGHT (SAME TIME) 145
-.. they catch the faintest glimpse of... themselves...
across the room... just as they EVAPORATE. Ron blinks.
Turns. Frowns.
RON

How'd you two get over there? I

was just talking to you... over

there.

Ron glances to the other side of the room. Frowns.
Hermione glances mischievously to Harry.

HERMIONE
What d'you think, Harry? Too much
for him -- everything that's

happened tonight?

HARRY
Afraid so. Always been a bit of
the nervous type, Ron has.

Ron stares at them, confounded. Slowly, they... GRIN.

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING 146

The Whomping Willow sways ina light breeze. The Black
Lake shimmers, clouds drifting in its glassy mirror.

INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN'S OFFICE - MORNING 147
Harry walks softly toward an OPEN DOOR -- Lupin's
office -- and peers in. Lupin stands over a battered

Suitcase, filling it with the last of his books. Without
turning, he SPEAKS.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Hello, Harry.

Harry JUMPS. Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Saw you coming.

The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk.
Harry nods, looks back to Lupin. Unable to disguise his
shock at Lupin's appearance.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I've looked worse, believe me.

Harry eyes the open desk drawers... the bare
bookshelves...

HARRY
You've been sacked.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Resigned, actually.

HARRY
Resigned! But why!

PROFESSOR LUPIN
It seems that someone has let slip
the nature of my condition.

HARRY
Snape.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Whoever. It was bound to get out.
This time tomorrow, the owls will
Start arriving. Parents will not
want a -- someone like me -teaching their children.

HARRY
But Dumbledore -
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Has already risked enough on my
behalf. Besides, people like me,
well... let's just say I'm used to
this by now. But before I go,
tell me about your Patrons.

HARRY
Well. At first I thought it was a
horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I
think it was -
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A stag.

HARRY
Yes.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father used to transform into
one. That's how he was able to
keep me company when I became...
Sick. He was a great friend
James.

Lupin smiles wanly, lifts his sorry suitcase. Then
stops.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
There are stories about him and your mother, you know.
Some are even true. But I think it's safe to say, in the
end, you'll know them best by getting to know yourself.
Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Mischief managed.

Harry watches the Map go blank. Looks back. Lupin is
gone.

OMITTED 148

INT. GREAT HALL -—- DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 149
Ron stands amid a circle of excited Gryffindors.

RON
Stand back, I said! I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle!

As Harry arrives, he glances at Hermione, who CLEARS HER
THROAT LOUDLY. The others turn, begin all speaking at
once.

NEVILLE
Harry! Wherever did you get it!

SEAMUS
Can I have a go, Harry? After
you, of course -
RON
Quiet!
(as they oblige)
Thank you. Let the man through.

Mystified, Harry steps forward, the boys peeling away,
clearing his view of the BROOMSTICK in Ron's hands. The
LABEL GLEAMS: "FIREBOLT. "

HARRY
Whose is that?

RON
(as everyone laughs)
Whose is it? It's yours, mate.

HARRY
But... how? Who?
HERMIONE
It's a mystery. Though... this

fell out of the wrapping.
Harry turns, sees Hermione holding up a FEATHER.

HARRY
That's a Hippogriff feather -
As Harry stops short, Hermione raises her eyebrow. As
they share a secret glance, we...

CUT TO:

INT./EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FRONT DOORS - DAY 150

BOOM! The huge vertical DOORS BURST OPEN and Harry,
trailed by the others, exits with the Firebolt. As he
strides off, others join the assembly -- Hagrid, Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle among them -- curious to see what the
commotion is all about.

EXT. COURTYARD -—- DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 151
As Harry stops, an expectant HUSH hangs over the moment.

SEAMUS
Go on, Harry.

NEVILLE
Yeah. Let's see.

Harry mounts the broom. Licks his finger and jabs it in
the air. A few others do the same. Hagrid does the
Same. Crabbe and Goyle start to do the same, when Malfoy
SLAPS their hands down. Finally, Harry places his hand
on the broom. Sets his grip. Takes a breath. And...

Frowns.

FRED/GEORGE
What's wrong?

HARRY
IT don't think it works. I think
it's defective.

A collective GROAN. Dejected, many of the kids begin to
drift toward the castle. Harry calls after.

HARRY
Oh, come on now. It's just a
broom.

HAGRID

(nodding sagely)
Just a broom.

Harry's eye shifts to Ron and Hermione. A wink.

HARRY
The fastest broom in the world.
As everyone turns -- WHOOSH! -- Harry JETS OFF and we -CUT TO:
EXT. HIGH IN THE SKY - DAY (SAME TIME) 152

A tiny DOT, GROWING LARGER AND LARGER, races upward.
It's Harry shooting straight into the blue on the
Firebolt. A SCREAM GROWS LOUDER as he approaches. A
scream of release, of utter abandon. It's Harry

screaming. But something else is clear as he JETS PAST
and...

The SCREEN GOES BLACK.

It's a SCREAM of joy.

FADE OUT.
